  abstract={Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) tests with loading conditions involving a combined thermal and mechanical strain cycle were carried out on a third generation ??-TiAl alloy with fine duplex microstructure. The experiments were conducted at a total strain amplitude of 0.6{\%} in out-of-phase (OP) and in-phase (IP) modes. The temperature range was kept constant at 250 ??C and the maximum temperatures applied were 700, 750 and 800 ??C. The TMF results revealed that thermomechanical loading conditions must be considered as very crucial for the design of components made of ??-TiAl alloys. In particular, out-of-phase loading conditions reduce fatigue life tremendously as compared to the corresponding isothermal conditions. The very short out-of-phase loading life can be attributed to an accelerated oxidation-induced crack initiation during tension in the low-temperature part of the TMF cycle and is a consequence of the formation of an embrittled zone at the surface during the high-temperature part of the loading cycle. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is applicable to isotropic metals subjected to arbitrary thermomechanical loading conditions at small strains. The focus of the model formulation is its validity for the full range of thermal and mechanical loading conditions to be covered in an industrial context by e.g. modern aero-engine designs. Consequently, the proposed model describes the material behavior on a macroscopic level covering the full temperature range from room temperature to the upper application limit under monotonic as well as cyclic loading. Special emphasis is also put on the correct representation of the observed ratcheting behavior. The most prominent features of the model are the combined treatment of both, rate dependent, as well as rate independent inelasticity through a limit surface concept, the description of primary, secondary and tertiary creep behavior and the application of an appropriate backstress evolution equation. A fully implicit integration algorithm for the proposed model is developed and implemented in connection with uniaxial integration point drivers as well as three alternative Finite Element packages. The parameters of the proposed model can be identified based on a limited number of complex cyclic tests and monotonic creep tests. After reporting on the fitting results for such tests for the Nickel-base superalloy \{IN718\} the predictive capabilities of the proposed model are assessed for a number of isothermal and nonisothermal tests.

TMF tests were performed at 400-800??C with mechanical strain amplitudes ranging from 0.15{\%} to 0.7{\%}. The tests were conducted thermomechanically in-phase (IP) and out-of-phase (OP).For the same lifetimes, uniaxial IP tests required the highest strain amplitudes, while OP test conditions were most damaging and needed the lowest strain amplitudes. The Mises equivalent mechanical strain amplitudes of pure torsional tests were found in between uniaxial in-phase and out-of-phase tests for the same lifetimes. The non-proportional multiaxial out-of-phase test showed a lower lifetime at the same equivalent mechanical strain amplitude compared to the other types of tests.The microstructure has been characterized applying electron microscopy and microstructural parameters such as fraction of twinned grains, grain size, lamellar distance and dislocation density have been quantified. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={The objective of this article is to suggest new Eulerian rate type constitutive models for isotropic finite deformation elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening etc. The main novelty of the suggested models is the use of the newly discovered logarithmic stress rate and the incorporation of a simple, natural explicit integrable-exactly rate type formulation of general hyperelasticity. Each new model is thus subjected to no incompatibility of rate type formulation for elastic behaviour with the notion of elasticity, as encountered by any other existing Eulerian rate type model for elastoplasticity or hypoelasticity. As particular cases, new Prandtl-Reuss equations for elastic-perfect plasticity and elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening, respectively, are presented for computational and practical purposes. Of them, the equations for kinematic hardening and combined isotropicšCkinematic hardening are, respectively, reduced to three uncoupled equations with respect to the spherical stress component, the shifted stress and the back-stress. The effects of finite rotation on the current strain and stress and hardening behaviour are indicated in a clear and direct manner. As illustrations, finite simple shear responses for the proposed models are studied by means of numerical integration. Further, it is proved that, among all possible (infinitely many) objective Eulerian rate type models, the proposed models are not only the first, but unique, self-consistent models of their kinds, in the sense that the rate type equation used to represent elastic behaviour is exactly integrable to really deliver an elastic relation. ?},

  abstract={Total strain-controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests of a nickel based superalloy were performed at 650. Â°C. Various hold times were introduced at the peak tensile strain to investigate the high-temperature creep-fatigue interaction (CFI) effects under the same temperature. A substantial decrease in fatigue life occurred as the total strain amplitude increased. Moreover, tensile strain holding further reduced fatigue life. The saturation phenomenon of holding effect was found when the holding period reached 120. s. Cyclic softening occurred during the LCF and CFI process and it was related to the total strain amplitude and the holding period. The relationship between life-time and total strain amplitude was obtained by combining Basquin equation and Coffin-Manson equation. The surface and fracture section of the fatigued specimens were observed via scanning electronic microscope (SEM) to determine the failure mechanism.},

  abstract={The critical plane approach is applied to model material fatigue behavior under any constant amplitude proportional loading. The most critical plane and the largest damage parameter are determined in closed form for six damage criteria that have been proposed in the literature. The correct procedures of utilizing these closed-form solutions to construct the damage parameter versus fatigue life curve are outlined. It is shown that the common practice of characterizing the material's fatigue behavior by plotting the damage parameter evaluated on the maximum shear plane against the observed fatigue life violates the principle of the critical plane approach, a problem which can arise during the calibration of any biaxial type of damage criterion. The study emphasizes that the critical plane approach should be consistently applied to both the initial calibration and the subsequent fatigue analysis.},

  abstract={The cyclic stress-strain response and the low cycle fatigue life of conventionally heat treated Inconel 718 were studied. Fully reversed strain-controlled tests were performed at room temperature and at 823 K. Optical and electron microscopy were used to study the development of deformation and cracking during cycling. A power-law relationship between life-time and plastic strain amplitude was obtained. A substantial decrease in fatigue life occurred as the temperature was increased from 298 to 823 K and as the cycling frequency was lowered from 3 cyclesJmin to 0.3 cyclesJmin at 823 K. At 298 K, for all the strain amplitudes investigated, an initial rapid hardening was followed by softening, while at 823 K only softening occurred. Electron microscopy showed that the precipitates were sheared in the course of cyclic straining and that plastic deformation proceeded by the propagation of planar bands. These bands were identified as twins. Twinning was found to be more abundant at elevated temperatures than at room temperature, especially at lower frequencies. Cracking was generally initiated along the interfaces between these twin bands and the matrix but, at elevated temperatures and low strain rates, intercrystalline cracking took place, as well. The influence of particles shearing and twinning on the cyclic stress-strain response of the material are discussed. The importance of planar deformation and twinning on intergranular cracking is emphasized.},

  abstract={An experimental program has been implemented to determine small offset yield loci under axial-torsional loading at elevated temperatures. The nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718) was chosen for study due to its common use in aeropropulsion applications. Initial and subsequent yield loci were determined for solutioned IN718 at 23, 371, and 454 C and for aged (precipitation hardened) IN718 at 23 and 649 C. The shape of the initial yield loci for solutioned and aged IN718 agreed well with the von Mises prediction. However, in general, the centers of initial yield loci were eccentric to the origin due to a strength-differential (S-D) effect that increased with temperature. Subsequent yield loci exhibited anisotropic hardening in the form of translation and distortion of the locus. This work shows that it is possible to determine yield surfaces for metallic materials at temperatures up to at least 649 C using multiple probes of a single specimen. The experimental data is first-of-its-kind for a superalloy at these very high temperatures and will facilitate a better understanding of multiaxial material response, eventually leading to improved design tools for engine designers.},

  abstract={An experimental test facility was developed to perform thermo-mechanical fatigue crack growth experiments. The thermal cycles were generated using hot and cold air flows distributed by a nozzle onto the test specimen. With the equipment it was possible to obtain TMF cycles with cycle times of 120 s with less than 10 °C temperature variation over the measurement length of the sample, cycling between 200 °C and 550 °C. The equipment allows TMF crack propagation tests up to, at least, 600 °C. The crack length and the crack closure level were determined using the potential drop technique. Thermo-mechanical fatigue crack propagation experiments were performed in-phase and out-of-phase with various R-values on samples of Inconel 718. Cylindrical specimens with a small starter crack were cycled in nominal total strain control. The crack propagation rate was determined and the correlation to the effective J-integral range, $\Delta$Jeff, corrected for crack closure presented. The fracture surfaces showed a dominance of trans-granular crack propagation with striations, indicating a low degree of time dependency in the procedure. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

  abstract={The uniaxial and non-proportionally multiaxial ratcheting behaviors of SS304 stainless steel at room temperature were initially researched by experiment and then were theoretically described by a cyclic constitutive model in the framework of unified visco-plasticity. The effects of cyclic stress amplitude, mean stress, and their histories on the ratcheting were experimentally investigated under uniaxial and different multiaxial loading paths. The shapes of non-proportional loading paths were linear, circular, elliptical and rhombic, respectively. In the constitutive model, the rate-dependent behavior of the material was reflected by a viscous term; the cyclic flow and cyclic hardening behaviors of the material under asymmetrical stress-controlled cycling were reflected by the evolution rules of kinematic hardening back stress and isotropic deforming resistance, respectively. The effect of loading history on the ratcheting was also considered by introducing two fading memorization functions for maximum inelastic strain amplitude and isotropic deformation resistance, respectively, into the constitutive model. The effect of multiaxial loading path on the ratcheting was reflected by a non-proportional factor defined in this work. The predicting ability of the developed model was proved to be good by comparing the simulations with corresponding experiments. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The investigation was performed in a two-year, six-task, combined experimental and analytical program. The path-independent integrals for application to time-dependent crack growth were critically reviewed. The crack growth was simulated using a finite element method. The path-independent integrals were computed from the results of finite-element analyses. The ability of these integrals to correlate experimental crack growth data were evaluated under various loading and temperature conditions. The results indicate that some of these integrals are viable parameters for crack growth prediction at elevated temperatures.},

  abstract={Abstract The thermo-mechanical uniaxial and biaxial-planar fatigue behavior of the forged nickel base superalloy Waspaloy? was investigated for in-phase and out-of-phase loading between 673 K and 923 K. At these temperatures also the uniaxial and biaxial-planar isothermal material behavior was studied. In order to determine the influence of the multiaxial stress state on the fatigue life biaxial-planar isothermal tests were carried out at three different strain ratios. The uniaxial isothermal lifetimes coincide very well with literature data. A conservative lifetime description for thermo-mechanical in-phase and out-of-phase fatigue test was set based on the isothermal tests at the upper temperature. The comparison of lifetimes from uniaxial and biaxial-planar tests shows that the equivalent strain hypothesis according to von Mises correlates the fatigue lives of the different stress states within a scatter band of two. The failure mechanism including crack initiation, crack growth and the macroscopic crack path were studied by scanning electron microscopy. A change from a mainly transgranular crack growth at 673 K to a mostly intergranular fracture at 923 K as well as under thermo-mechanical fatigue loading was found. The fatigue lives of the isothermal and thermo-mechanical tests under both uniaxial and biaxial-planar loading were correlated by a new lifetime model which is based on a stress¨Cstrain approach.},

In general there was cyclic softening both in the bare as well as salt coated specimens. Variation of fatigue life with plastic strain amplitude followed Coffin-Manson relationship. Reduction in fatigue life from salt coating was found to be associated with early crack initiation from the roots of corrosion pits on the surface and faster crack propagation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Uniaxial deformation and fatigue data of this steel were already available. Monotonic and cyclic deformation curves are predicted from the von Mises and Tresca criteria and compared to the torsional data. Three types of torsional fatigue tests involving shear mean stress as well as tensile and compressive mean stresses were also performed in order to gain a better understanding as to how to predict the behavior of the material under such loading. The stress-life (S-N) approach and strain-life curve based on commonly used failure criteria are evaluated. Failure modes and fracture surfaces were observed and are discussed with regards to the failure criteria commonly used for life predictions.

  abstract={This study investigates torsional deformation and fatigue behavior of both solid and thin-walled tube specimens made of a high strength quenched and tempered spring steel. Uniaxial deformation and fatigue data of this steel were already available. Monotonic and cyclic deformation curves are predicted from the von Mises and Tresca criteria and compared to the torsional data. Three types of torsional fatigue tests involving shear mean stress as well as tensile and compressive mean stresses were also performed in order to gain a better understanding as to how to predict the behavior of the material under such loading. The stress-life (S-N) approach and strain-life curve based on commonly used failure criteria are evaluated. Failure modes and fracture surfaces were observed and are discussed with regards to the failure criteria commonly used for life predictions. The differences in cyclic deformation and fatigue behaviors between solid round specimens where a stress gradient exists, and thin-walled tube specimens where a uniform stress state is commonly assumed, are also discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The specimens are loaded with different strain rates. The material shows a significantly higher crack growth rate if the strain rate is decreased. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is adopted to identify the failure mechanism and the misorientation relationship of failed grain boundaries in secondary cracks. The analyzed cracks propagated mainly transgranular but also intergranular failure can be observed in some areas. It is found that grain boundaries with coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundary structure are generally less susceptible for intergranular failure than grain boundaries with random misorientation. For modeling the experimentally identified crack behavior an existing model for fatigue crack growth based on the mechanism of time dependent elastic–plastic crack tip blunting is enhanced to describe environmental effects based on the mechanism of oxygen diffusion at the crack tip. For the diffusion process the temperature dependent parabolic diffusion law is assumed. As a result, the time dependent cyclic crack tip opening displacement ($\Delta$CTOD) is used as representative value to describe both mechanisms. Thus, most of the included model parameters characterize the deformation behavior of the material and can be determined by independent material tests. With the determined material properties, the proposed model describes the experimentally measured crack growth curves very well.

  abstract={A path-independent multiaxial fatigue damage criterion is proposed based on critical plane concepts: fatigue crack growth is controlled by the maximum shear strain, and an important secondary effect is due to the normal strain excursion over one reversal of the maximum shear strain. The effect of loading path on fatigue endurance is quantified by the normal strain excursion. Only one multiaxial material constant is required in the model which can be determined from uniaxial test data plus one torsional result. The parameter can be easily integrated with a shear strain-life relationship to predict low cycle fatigue lifetime. Experimental data of four different materials: En1 5R steel, I{\%} Cr-Mo-V steel, 304 stainless steel, and 316 stainless steel at two temperatures were used to verify the criterion. It is shown that the proposed parameter can satisfactorily correlate test results for various proportional and non-proportional straining paths.},

  abstract={The axial, strain-controlled, cyclic fatigue behavior of direct age alloy 718 is investigated. Ramberg-Osgood (R-O) cyclic stress-cyclic strain relationships were determined at each temperature. The results were used to assess the fatigue life as functions of the R-O alternating plastic strain and R-O alternating stress. As temperature decreased, a departure from Coffin-Manson behavior was observed. The fatigue lives at 149, 315 and 454 °C, plotted as a function of the R-O alternating stress, converge when superimposed and a crossover in the responses is observed. Under fixed alternating stress conditions, the fatigue life below the crossover increases as the temperature increases whilst above, a reversion in the fatigue life temperature dependence is seen. A mechanistic model is proposed which seeks to rationalize the increase in fatigue life, as a function of increasing test temperature, to a thermally activated process that mitigates the generation of substructure defects associated with grain boundary stress concentrations. The model activation energy and activation volume are interpreted to substantiate a mechanism whereby a diffusive flux, away from grain boundary stress concentrations, is enabled by the non-conservative motion of grain boundary dislocations in a grain boundary plane containing obstacles. The model predictions are in reasonable agreement with experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The elevated temperature, uniaxial fatigue behavior of the precipitation hardened, Ni-based superalloys Waspaloy1Waspaloy is a trademark of United Technologies Corporation.1and direct age (DA) alloy 718 are examined. The fatigue life is treated as a thermally activated process. An apparent activation energy and apparent activation volume are derived by considering the external work applied and energy stored in the material due to interactions between dislocations and pinning obstacles. A fatigue life relationship is developed and compared to the experimental fatigue behavior. The experimental behavior is adequately explained by the model. The model physical parameters are related to the thermophysical and microstructural properties of each alloy system examined. The variation in fatigue life is also examined based on the microstructure sensitive model parameters. It is proposed that thermal activation enhances fatigue life by reducing stress concentrations responsible for the generation of substructure defects at a critical stress level below where mechanical damage dominates fatigue life. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract={Low-cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior of nickel-based precipitation -strengthened superalloy GH4145/SQ was investigated systematically under fully reversed total strain amplitude control conditions at 538 ??C in laboratory air. It was shown that the alloy exhibited a pronounced initial fatigue hardening followed by continuous fatigue softening to failure at high strain amplitudes, while at low strain amplitudes the initial hardening was followed by a well-defined saturation stage. Microstructure observations using optical and transmission-electron microscopy revealed that slip band density increased with increasing total strain amplitudes and the size of the ?????precipitates tended to reduction due to repeated shearing by the dislocations with continuous cyclic straining. The above changes in microstructures during cycling were essentially responsible for the fatigue hardening-softening behavior of the alloy. Both optical and SEM micrographs indicated that at low strain amplitudes crack propagation was basically transgranular, while at high strain amplitudes crack propagation was essentially intergranular. Bilinear behavior with a change of slope at a plastic strain amplitude of about 0.2 pct was observed in cyclic stress-strain (CSS), Coffin-Manson (C-M) and plastic strain energy-life plots. A change in the number of operating slip systems and the fracture modes with the strain amplitude employed was used to explain this two-slope characteristic. In both the companion specimens test (CST) and the incremental step test (IST) methods the alloy exhibited non-masing type behavior. It was suggested that, for the first approximation, the half-life plastic strain energy could be calculated directly according to the equation without reckoning in the non-masing behavior. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.
