\chapter{Experimental apparatus and results of Inconel 718}

\section{Material specification}
\noindent The nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 investigated in the present work is manufactured by ThyssenKrupp, Germany, and provided in rods of 20mm diameter.
According to the standard ASTM B637 \cite{ASTMB63716}, the rods were solution-treated at 980$^{\circ}$C for one and a half hour then cooled to room temperature by water.
Then they were aged for eight hours at 720$^{\circ}$C, furnace cooled at 56$^{\circ}$C/h to 621$^{\circ}$C, where they were held for eight hours and forced air cooling to room temperature.
The chemical composition of the nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718 in the research is given in Table \ref{Tab:ChemicalCompositionofIN718}.

Microstructure of the heat-treated alloys was characterized by a optical microscope.
A typical optical micrograph is shown in \ref{Fig:MicrostructureofInconel718}.
It was observed that the grain size was about 15$\rm{\mu m}$ and in some local regions the grain size distribution was inhomogeneous.

\section{Specimens and test facilities}
\label{Sec:Specimens}
\noindent Monotonic tensile and uniaxial isothermal fatigue tests were performed by using the solid cylindrical specimen.
Its geometry is shown in \ref{Fig:Specimen}(a), a total length of 185mm, a outer diameter of the gauge section of 10mm and 35mm in gauge length.
The outer surface roughness values of $R_a=0.1\rm{\mu m}$.
The advantage of solid specimen is easy to be manufactured.

\caption{Geometry of the specimens investigated in the present work. (a) The solid cylindrical tensile bar. (b) The tubular specimen for tension-torsion tests.}
\label{Fig:Specimen}
\end{figure}
All multiaxial fatigue testing specimens were in thin-walled tubular shape.
The thin-walled tubular specimen geometry is shown in \ref{Fig:Specimen}(b), 185mm in the total length, a gauge length of 35mm, a outer diameter of the gage section of 12mm and a inner diameter of the specimen of 10mm.
Thus the wall thickness of the tubular specimen in the gauge section is 1mm.
Advantages of tubular specimens are that they offer a uniform stresses gage length, the stresses can be calculated directly from the applied loads.
Moreover, uniform temperature distributions in the gage length of the tubular specimens are easily achieved by induction heating, since relatively simple shape induction coils can be employed.

%\centering\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{IN718_Multiaxial_Specimen.pdf}}
%\caption{Dimensions of tubular specimen for biaxial test.}
%\label{Fig:IN718_Multiaxial_Specimen}
%\end{figure}

Both solid and thin-walled tubular specimens were designed by taking into the account of the available testing equipments and loading conditions, e.g. the gauge length of the extensometer, the height of the support frame of the extensometer, the height of the furnace and coil, and so on.
The experiments confirmed that the specimen geometry influenced the temperature distribution in the gauge length.
Consequently the final geometries which presented in the above figures were determined by experimental and numerical analysis.
The dimensions of solid and tubular specimens are adapt to the dimension ratios suggested by the standards ASTM E606 \cite{astm1998standard} and E2207 \cite{standard2007e2207}, respectively.
A discussion of different multiaxial testing techniques can be found in Socie (2000) \cite{socie2000multiaxial}.
All specimens were manufactured by a CNC machining center and the surfaces were polished prior to testing.


%Axial and biaxial loading tests were respectively conducted on the solid and thin-walled tubular specimen.
%Dimensions of the specimens are shown in Figure \ref{Fig:IN718_Axial_Specimen} and \ref{Fig:IN718_Multiaxial_Specimen}.
%The dimensions of both type specimens have to fulfill the standards, e.g. ASTM E606 \cite{astm1998standard} and E2207 \cite{standard2007e2207}, and match the extensometer, the furnace height and the induction coil shape.

%Several requirements should be considered to determine the dimensions of the two type specimens.
%Firstly, ASTM E606\cite{astm1998standard} and E2207\cite{standard2007e2207} standards should be fulfilled.
%Secondly, the high temperature extensometers and furnace or induction coil need enough space to be installed.
%Thirdly, we notice that the specimen geometries influence the temperature distribution of the whole specimen.
%Consequently the final geometries are determined by the numerical analysis and temperature measurement.


\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{equipment.pdf}}
\caption{Induction heating system with biaxial test system MTS809.}
\label{Fig:Equipment}
\end{figure}

Experiments were performed in a servo controlled hydraulic system (MTS 809) with both a electric resistance furnace (MTS 653) and a induction heating system (TruHeat HF 3010).
The system is capable of applying axial and biaxial loads with temperature controlled simultaneously.

\label{Fig:MTS809}
\end{figure}
Thus, uniaxial and biaxial stress states can be generated under a certain temperature in the gauge length of the specimen.
\ref{Fig:Equipment} shows the induction heating system.
The strains were measured by the high temperature axial and biaxial extensometers which contact the specimen surface with two ceramic rods.
The gauge lengths of the axial and biaxial extensometers are 12mm and 25mm respectively.

The shape of the induction coil influences the temperature distribution of the specimens.
Induction heating efficiency is dependent on the coil density and the distance between the coil and specimen surface.
Concentrated coil density and short distance to the specimen surface result in high heat flux, vice versa.
We need to adjustment the coil to optimize the axial temperature distribution.
The maximum temperature deviations along the 12mm gauge length were $\pm5^{\circ}$C and along the 25mm gauge length were $\pm8^{\circ}$C.



\section{Monotonic tensile tests}
\noindent Monotonic tensile test is the fundamental material test in which a specimen is subjected to a controlled tension until failure.
The purpose of this portion of the testing program was to develop the Inconel 718 mechanical property data for use in the finite-element calculations.

The monotonic tensile tests were performed under four temperatures 20$^{\circ}$C, 300$^{\circ}$C, 550$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C.
All tests procedures followed the ASTM standard E21.09.
The heating apparatus was the electric resistance furnace (MTS Model 653) and the specimens were in the air at atmospheric pressure.
Temperature was measured by the type K thermocouples which were sufficiently sensitive and reliable.
%The temperature measurement sensor was the type K thermocouple which was sufficiently sensitive and reliable to ensure that the temperature of the specimen is within the limits specified in the gauge length.
At the beginning of each test with force kept constant at zero and the specimen was heated to the set temperature and held on for an hour to ensure the temperature distribution of the specimen became stabilization.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering{\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Furnace653_1.jpg}}
\caption{MTS model 653 resistance furnace.}
%\caption{MTS-809 轴向/扭转复合疲劳材料试验机与感应加热系统.}
\label{Fig:Furnace653_1}
\end{figure}

%Before the mechanical tension load applied, all specimens were heated to the set temperature by the resistance furnace and held the temperature for an hour until the temperature distribution of the specimen became to the steady state.
For the duration of each test, the temperature deviations between the indicated and nominal values were less than $\pm1.5^{\circ}$C.
The tensile tests were performed in strain control at the predetermined strain rate $1.0\times 10^{-4}\rm{s}^{-1}$.
The extensometer was removed after the axial strain reached 6\% and then the tests were changed to displacement control mode.
The test program is listed in Table \ref{tab:TensionLoadingConditions}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{Monotonic tensile test program.}
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
    Temperature & Temperature deviation & Remove point of extensometer  & Strain rate  \\
    \midrule
    20$^{\circ}$C  & 0.1$^{\circ}$C & $6.0\%$ & $1.0\times 10^{-4} \rm{s}^{-1}$ \\
    300$^{\circ}$C & 0.6$^{\circ}$C & $6.0\%$ & $1.0\times 10^{-4} \rm{s}^{-1}$ \\
    550$^{\circ}$C & 1.3$^{\circ}$C & $6.0\%$ & $1.0\times 10^{-4} \rm{s}^{-1}$ \\
    650$^{\circ}$C & 1.5$^{\circ}$C & $6.0\%$ & $1.0\times 10^{-4} \rm{s}^{-1}$ \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
  \label{tab:TensionLoadingConditions}%
\end{table}%

%The test process involves placing the specimen in the testing machine, calibrating the zero point of force and extensometer , heating the specimen to the indicated temperature and slowly extending it until it fractures.
%Finally, the specimen was carefully removed and examined.
%During this process, The axial strain rate keeps constant as $1 \times 10^{-4}$s$^{-1}$.
%Extensometer measurement values of the gauge section is recorded against the applied force.
The elongation and force measurements are used to calculate the engineering stress $\sigma_{eng}$ and engineering strain $\varepsilon_{eng}$, using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{eng}=\frac{F}{A_0},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{eng}=\frac{l-l_0}{l_0},
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the axial force, $A_0$ is the specimen initial cross-sectional area, $\Delta l$ is the change of gauge length, $l_0$ and $l$ are the initial and final gauge lengths of the specimen.
Noting that, it is recommended to use true stress $\sigma$ and logarithmic strain $\varepsilon$ in large deformation condition, and they can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma=\sigma_{eng}(1+\varepsilon_{eng}),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon=\ln(1+\varepsilon_{eng}).
\end{equation}

\ref{Fig:IN718_Monotonic_Tension} shows the variation of the Inconel 718 tension stress-strain curves with different test temperatures 20$^{\circ}$C, 300$^{\circ}$C, 550$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C.
The material properties of different temperatures can be determined from the experimental data, e.g. Young's modulus, yield strength, ultimate stress and fracture elongation (see Table \ref{tab:General_material_mechanical_properties}).
There was a considerable decline in Young's modulus, yield strength and ultimate stress with the increase of temperature.
%With the increase of temperature, the Young's modulus, yield strength shows a certain decline.
However, the fracture elongation was insensitivity with the temperature.
As a result, the material still retains reasonable strength at 650$^{\circ}$C.

\section{Isothermal fatigue tests}
\noindent Both uniaxial and multi-axial strain controlled isothermal low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were performed with the inductive heating device.
The temperatures were measured and controlled by thermocouples wrapped around the specimen surface at the center of the gauge section of the specimen.
The strain were measured and controlled by the uniaxial extensometer MTS model 632.53 and the biaxial extensometer MTS model 632.68.

All isothermal fatigue tests were carried out with a given loading ratio $R_{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon_{\min}/\varepsilon_{\max}=-1$.
Six fully reversed stain paths were illustrated in \ref{Fig:LoadPath}.
The tension compression strain path is shown in \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(a) and denoted as 'TC' for short.
All tension compression tests were performed on solid specimens (see \ref{Fig:Specimen}(a)).
Pure torsional, proportional and non-proportional tests were performed on tubular specimens (see \ref{Fig:Specimen}(b)).
The strain path torsional, proportional, corss, diamond and circle are shown in \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(b)-(f) and they are respectively denoted as 'TOR', 'CROSS', 'PRO', 'DIAMOND' and 'CIRCLE'.

For the duration of each test, the temperature deviations between the indicated and nominal values were less than $\pm3^{\circ}$C.


A triangular waveform was applied at a prescribed frequency of 0.05Hz over the strain range of $\pm 0.6\%$ to $\pm 1.0\%$, i.e. the strain rates were below $1.0\times 10^{-3}\rm{s}^{-1}$ for all tests.
The strain peak  $\varepsilon_{\max}$ and valley $\varepsilon_{\min}$ were given to the controlling software.
The default peak and valley compensation method was used to obtain an accurate feedback value.
All uniaxial fatigue tests were performed at the temperature range of 300$^{\circ}$C to 650$^{\circ}$C in total strain control by the MTS Multipurpose software (MPE).
Failure was deemed to have occurred if the peak load dropped 15\% from the stabilized peak. a 20\% load drop In comparing with the maximum load  was defined as failure, corresponding to nucleation of macro cracks.
The cyclic tests were quitted at 50,000 loading cycles.

The multi-axial cyclic tests involved simultaneous axial and torsional loading with the prescribed phase relationship.
The test procedure was adapt to the standard ASTM E2207-15 which deals with strain-controlled, axial, torsional and combined in-phase and out-of-phase axial torsional fatigue testing with thin-walled tubular specimens under isothermal condition.
The axial strain $\varepsilon$ refers to engineering axial strain, defined as $\varepsilon=\Delta L_g/L_g$. The engineering shear strain $\gamma$ is defined as twist of the specimen.

The thermo-mechanical experiments consisted of axial, torsional and non-proportional cyclic tests with temperature range from 300$^{\circ}$C to 650$^{\circ}$C. The loading conditions for each type of tests are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Loading-Conditions}.
Strain path is described by axial strain $\varepsilon$ and shear strain $\gamma$ in a cycle under the  strain-control conditions. The proportional loading path and the non-proportional loading paths are shown in Figures \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(b) to (d), respectively.

%\subsection{Multiaxial fatigue tests}
Multiaxial tests involved simultaneous axial and torsional loading with the prescribed phase relationship.
The test procedure was adapt to the standard ASTM E2207-15 which deals with strain-controlled, axial, torsional, and combined in-phase and out-of-phase axial torsional fatigue testing with thin-walled, circular cross-section, tubular specimens at isothermal, ambient and elevated temperatures.
Some concepts are defined as follows:

Axial strain $\varepsilon$, refers to engineering axial strain, and is defined as change in length divided by the original length $\Delta L_g/L_g$.

Shear strain $\gamma$, refers to engineering shear strain, resulting from the application of a torsional moment to a cylindrical specimen.
Such a torsional shear strain is simple shear and is defined similar to axial strain with the exception that the shearing displacement, $\Delta L_s$ is perpendicular to rather than parallel to the gage length, $L_g$, that is, $\gamma=\Delta L_s/L_g$.
%$\gamma$ is related to the angles of twist, $\theta$ and $\Psi$ as follows: $\gamma=\tan \Psi$
As shown in \ref{Fig:Shear_Strain}, $\Psi$ is the angle of twist along the gage length of the cylindrical specimen, $\theta$ expressed in radians is the angle of twist between the planes defining the gage length of the cylindrical specimen.
$\theta$ is measurable directly as angle using specially calibrated torsional extensometers.
Thus, we have $\gamma = (d/2)\theta/ L_g$.
Biaxial strain amplitude ratio $\lambda$, is defined as the ratio of the shear strain amplitude $\gamma_a$ to the axial strain amplitude $\varepsilon_a$, that is, $\gamma_a/\varepsilon_a$.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{shear_strain.pdf}}
\caption{Twisted gage section of a cylindrical specimen due to a torsional moment.}
\label{Fig:Shear_Strain}
\end{figure}

Axial stress $\sigma$, refers to the engineering stress, which is the ratio of force, $F$, to specimen original cross sectional area, A, that is, $\sigma=F/A$.

Shear stress $\tau$, refers to engineering shear stress, acting in the orthogonal tangential and axial directions of the gage section and is a result of the applied torsional moment, (Torque) $T$, to the thin-walled tubular specimen. The shear stress, like the shear strain, is always the greatest at the outer diameter. Under elastic loading conditions, shear stress also varies linearly through the thin wall of the tubular specimen. However, under elasto-plastic loading conditions, shear stress tends to vary in a nonlinear fashion. Most strain-controlled axial-torsional fatigue tests are conducted under elasto-plastic loading conditions. Therefore, assumption of a uniformly distributed shear stress is recommended. The relationship between such a shear stress applied at the mean diameter of the gage section and the torsional moment, $T$, is
\begin{equation}
\tau=\frac{16T}{\pi(d_o^2-d_i^2)(d_o+d_i)},
\end{equation}
where, $\tau$ is the shear stress, $d_o$ and $d_i$ are the outer and inner diameters of the tubular test specimen, respectively.

The experimental program consisted of axial, torsional and non-proportional cyclic tests with temperature range from 300$^{\circ}$C to 650$^{\circ}$C.
%All experiments are strain controlled and the stress-strain hysteresis loops were recorded for each cycles.
The loading conditions for each type of tests are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Loading-Conditions}.
Strain path, is defined as the combination of axial strain $\varepsilon$ and shear strain $\gamma$ in a cycle under the biaxial loaded strain-controlled conditions. Such as uniaxial strain path (\ref{Fig:LoadPath}(a)), proportional strain path (\ref{Fig:LoadPath}(b)) and non-proportional strain path (\ref{Fig:LoadPath}(c,d)).

In this section we will introduce the multiaxial thermomechanical fatigue testing process.
As the name implies the multiaxial thermomechanical fatigue testing is combined with the multiaxial mechanical testing and thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) testing.

\section{Thermomechanical fatigue testing}
Thermomechanical fatigue testing is a variant of fatigue testing designed to simulate real-world service conditions of engineered components.
Specifically, TMF tests characterize the response of materials to both cyclic mechanical loading and fluctuating temperature, which produce a synergistic response that may not be well-predicted with isothermal fatigue testing.
TMF tests are most frequently conducted on high-temperature alloys used injet engines, using a combination of in-phase and out-of-phase mechanical and thermal cycling.

ASTM E2368-10 is the standard practice for thermomechanical fatigue testing under uniaxially loaded strain-controlled conditions.
Unfortunately we do not have a standard for the TMF testing under biaxial loaded strain-controlled conditions.
According to the standard, a thermomechanical fatigue cycle is here defined as a condition where uniform temperature and strain fields over the specimen gage section are simultaneously varied and independently controlled.
Some concepts are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Coefficient of thermal expansion} $\alpha$, the fractional change in free expansion strain for a unit change in temperature, as measured on the test specimen.
  \item \textbf{Thermal strain} $\varepsilon_{th}$, the strain component resulting from a change in temperature under free expansion conditions.
  \[\varepsilon_{th}=\alpha\Delta T\]
  \item \textbf{Mechanical strain} $\varepsilon_{m}$, the strain component resulting when the free expansion thermal strain specimen is subtracted from the total strain.
  \item \textbf{Total strain} $\varepsilon_t$, the strain component measured on the test specimen, and is the sum of the thermal strain and the mechanical strain.
  \[\varepsilon_t=\varepsilon_m+\varepsilon_{th}\]
  \item \textbf{Strain ratio} $R_{\varepsilon}$, the ratio of minimum mechanical strain to the maximum mechanical strain in a strain cycle.
  \[R_{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon_{m,min}/\varepsilon_{m,max}\]
  \item \textbf{Mechanical strain/temperature phase angle} $\varphi$, for the purpose of assessing phasing accuracy, this is defined as the waveform shift (expressed in degrees) between the maximum temperature response as measured on the specimen and the maximum mechanical strain response. For reference purpose, the angle $\varphi$ is considered positive if the temperature response maximum leads the mechanical strain response maximum by $180^\circ$ or less, otherwise the phase angle is considered to be negative.
      The phase $\varphi$ between temperature and mechanical strain can be chosen between $-180^\circ$ and $180^\circ$.
      One of the special case is $\varphi=0^\circ$ where the maximum and minimum of temperature and strain are reached at the same time. This is called in-phase TMF.
      The other special case is $\varphi=180^\circ$ where the maximum value of temperature leads the maximum value of mechanical strain by a time value equal to $1/2$ the cycle period. This is called out-of-phase (anti-phase) TMF.
      As shown in \ref{Fig:Thermomechanical_phase}, the vertical coordinates are strain $\varepsilon$ and temperature T.

\section{Development and verification of the induction heating system}

\section{ABAQUS user interface UMAT}
ABAQUS user subroutines are usually used to extend the ABAQU FEM solver to include user-defined functionalities not implemented in the ABAQUS source code.
The UMAT (User MATerial)interface provided by the ABAQUS solver for user-defined material laws and plasticity models is described in detail in \cite{abaqus20106}. In the following, we briefly discuss important variables and functions.

A UMAT routine is called at least once per time step during an FEM calculation for each integration point.
Inputs of the UMAT routine are the stress-strain state at the current time, all state variables and constants of the plasticity model, and the strain increment to be applied in the current time step.
Within the UMAT routine, the constitutive equations of the plasticity model are solved in the form of a differential equation system using a corresponding numerical solution method.
Subsequently, the new stress-strain state and the updated state variables are returned to the ABAQUS solver.
If the expansion increment is too large, and a solution of the constitutive equations with the necessary accuracy is not possible, the variable PNEWDT is returned to a new smaller step.
A UMAT routine thus operates on an incremental basis.
When it is viewed as a "black box," the corresponding conversion increment is simply expressed for each expansion increment entered into the UMAT routine:

\begin{equation}
\Delta \sigma_{ij}=UMAT(\Delta \varepsilon_{ij}).
\end{equation}

Since the present UMAT routines are programmed in FORTRAN and are not based on internal functions of the ABAQUS solver, it is possible to use these UMAT routines and thus also the included plasticity models "stand-alone" without the ABAQUS solver in a separate FORTRAN based environment.
It is only necessary to ensure that the plasticity models receive the necessary input variables via the UMAT interface and the existing status variables and output variables are buffered accordingly.
%This possibility is used here for multi-axial non-proportional notch strain simulation.
Significant variables of the ABAQUS-UMAT interface used are listed in \ref{tab:ABAQUS-UMAT_interface}.

\section{Heat and heat transfer}
The internal, thermal energy of a body or of a component is referred to as its "heat" in general terms and in a manner of speaking. In fact, heat is the thermal energy, the exchange of which is preceded by the temperature difference alone. The thermal energy of a body, which is stored as a kinetic energy in the non-directed particle motion at the molecular level, is changed by heat input and exhaust.
The storage capacity for thermal energy of a substance is expressed by its specific heat capacity $c$.
This characteristic value indicates the thermal energy related to the mass, which is necessary to heat up the material by 1 K.
The heat capacity depends on the temperature.
The relationship between mass and volume of the substance is described by the density $\rho$.
As a result of the thermal expansion of a material, its density normally decreases with increasing temperature.
Heat transfer is carried out by heat transport.
Heat transport always takes place at right angles to the levels of the same temperature (isotherms) in the direction of the negative temperature gradient.
Under constant boundary conditions, the temperature field approaches a stationary, stable state with increasing time.
The case of the stationary state thus denotes a temperature field that no longer has any temporal dependence.
According to Baehr and Stephan [8], three types of heat transport can be distinguished: heat conduction, heat radiation and convection.
These species may occur isolated or combined.

\subsection{Heat conduction}

The energy transport between adjacent molecules of a system is referred to as heat conduction.
The relevant parameter for this mechanism is the thermal conductivity k of the material.
For simplified calculations, this characteristic value is often defined as being independent of temperature, however, the value of the thermal conductivity is to be regarded as temperature-dependent.
For thermally isotropic material behavior, this scalar proportionality factor describes the relationship between the gradient of the scalar temperature field $T$ and the heat flux in the heat conduction law according to Fourier \cite{fourier1822theorie}:


\begin{equation}
\dot{q} =  - k\nabla T
\end{equation}


The minus sign in equation (2.1) takes account of the fact that the heat flow points in the direction of the negative temperature gradient.

\subsection{Heat radiation}
Heat transport by electromagnetic waves is called heat radiation. In contrast to the other types of heat transport, heat radiation can also take place in a vacuum, so no medium needs to be used. The heat flow due to heat radiation is according to Stefan [61] and Boltzmann [11]:


\subsection{Convection}

If the heat transport is carried out by transfer from one medium to another as a result of particle movement at the macroscopic level, this is referred to as a convective heat transfer. The characteristic feature here is that the heat transport takes place at a boundary layer and with the participation of a flowing medium (fluid or gas).

Due to the difference between the temperatures of the flowing medium $T_{\infty}$ and the body $T_s$ under consideration, a heat flow occurs.
The heat transfer coefficient is the defined proportionality factor by which the relationship between the temperature difference and the heat flow density is described:

Since the heat transfer coefficient as a single characteristic covers a large number of influences which characterize the processes in the boundary layer flow between the medium and the body (viscosity, flow properties, etc.), these values are usually either determined experimentally or recalculated from fluid dynamics by approximation methods from the heat flow.
The heat transfer coefficients can be exported directly as a time- or temperature-dependent variable from flow-mechanical calculations.
In order to recalculate these transition coefficients from the thermal current density determined in a flow simulation, knowledge of the temperature-dependent material parameters of the materials involved is necessary.
For turbulent heat transitions, case-related correlations exist (eg according to Dittus and Boelter [17] for turbulent tube flows) which are used for these purposes.

In the case of natural convection due to the free flow of water to steel, ecological values of 100 w / m2K to 600 w / m2K are customary for the transition coefficient. For forced convection, the flow velocity is determined by external influences. In these cases, the transition coefficient can increase to several tens of thousands of w / m2K. Even higher values are possible if condensation and evaporation occurs in the region of the boundary layer. More detailed information can be found in Herwig [32]. Due to the dependency of the transition coefficient on both the temperature and the temperature difference, the thermal current density in this case is not proportional to the temperature difference. For forced convection, the heat transfer coefficient can be regarded as independent of the temperature difference (see Baehr and Stephan [8]).

For applications in which both convection and heat radiation have to be taken into account, the heat transfer coefficient uk is often modified to cover both effects [8].

For the calculations carried out in this work, the differential equation of the heat conduction (2.1) is solved using the FE program package Ansys. The thermal boundary conditions are defined by convection boundary conditions. The calculation procedure for the determination of the temperature field solution is presented in chapter 3 in detail.

\section{Thermal expansion and thermal stress}

The internal thermal energy of a body increases with the addition of heat. This energy leads to an increase in the oscillation amplitude of the particle motion at the molecular level. This kinetic energy of the non-directed particle motion manifests itself at the macroscopic level as the temperature of the body. The increase in kinetic energy also causes general materials to expand with increasing temperature. This increase in the volume due to thermal expansion is described by the coefficient of expansion ax, which establishes the relationship between the thermal expansion eth and the temperature difference AT:

The temperature expansion coefficient ax is dependent on the temperature interval under consideration between an initial or reference temperature and a final or target temperature. For example, with a temperature-dependent coefficient of expansion, a temperature change of 50 K at different output temperature levels can result in different thermal expansion. The thermal elongations are purely volumetric for thermally isotropic material behavior.

If the material can deform freely, the thermal expansion is reversible. If the thermal expansion is hindered, this can mean that the thermal expansion field violates the compatibility. This disability can result from various causes:

Storage conditions

temperature gradient

Material transitions or material composites

While the storage conditions usually represent an external strain impairment, the other two points represent internal strain impairment. These lead to locally different thermal elongations due to different temperatures (temperature gradient) or different coefficients of expansion (material transitions). In reality, these phenomena rarely occur in isolation, but mixed and hybrid cases in which the abovementioned conditions are fulfilled or interactively fulfilled.

In all cases, the dilatation impairs compatibility. This induces a mechanical strain field which restores the compatibility. From this mechanical strain field results a stress field, which is referred to as heat stress.

In the case of bodies which are additionally stressed by mechanical boundary conditions in addition to a temperature load, this leads to a distinction between thermal and mechanical strain, particularly at the end of a numerical analysis, but it is not clear which part of the mechanical strain and thus also Which induces stresses from the temperature field or cause the mechanical stress.

According to [12] distinguishes between forced and uncommitted thermal stresses. Forced thermal stresses occur as the cause of external boundary conditions (storage), non-forced thermal stresses are the result of an internal strain impediment by temperature gradients or material transitions.

\section{Plasticity}

If the stress state of a material exceeds a limit state, a disproportionate increase in the strain occurs.
This limit state is usually formulated via a flow condition set with the stress tensor.
If it is fulfilled by the current stress tensor, plastic strains occur.
If this is fulfilled by the current stress tensor, plastic strains occur.
These plastic strains are described by material models which represent the elastic-plastic deformation behavior by suitable flow and hardening rules.
A basic assumption is that for small strains and isotropic material, the strain tensor can be additively split into an elastic and plastic part:

Even in the presence of plastic strains, the elastic part of the strain tensor also follows Hooke's law:

For isotropic material, the elastic tensor is dependent on two free parameters, the Lame constants.
The relationship between them and the Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio u by:

The components of the elastic tensor are

\section{Yield criterion}
The yield criterion is defined as the limit state of stress from which plastic material behavior occurs.
For the material models used in this work, the yield criterion of Mises \cite{mises1928mechanik} is used.
It is formulated as a function of the deviatoric stress $\bm{s}$.
Thus, only the shape-changing part of the stress tensor has an influence on the yield behavior, the volume-changing hydrostatic part is not taken into account in the yield criterion.
For metallic materials, this yield is considered to be usable and generally accepted.
The deviatoric stress $\bm{s}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\bm{s} = \bm{\upsigma}-\frac{1}{3}\rm{tr}(\bm{\upsigma}),
\end{equation}
and the yield criterion according to von Mises is:
\begin{equation}
F(\bm{s},{\bf{a}},k) = (\bm{s}-{\bf{a}}):(\bm{s}-{\bf{a}})-k^2.
\label{Equ:MisesCriterion}
\end{equation}
In the main stress space, the area defined by Equation \ref{Equ:MisesCriterion} describes a cylinder surface with a radius $k$, the center axis of which is along the hydrostatic axis (equisetrix).
The pure deviatoric tensor $\bf{a}$ allows the consideration kinematic hardening by a shift of the middle or anchor point of the yield surface.
The deviatoric yield stress is determined by the uniaxial yield stress according to:
\begin{equation}
k = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \sigma_y.
\end{equation}

\section{Flow rule}
The flow rule is used to determine the plastic strain increments.
This is a evolution equation which establishes the relation between the plastic potential and the plastic multiplier to the increment of the plastic strain.
If the yield criterion is the same used for the potential, it is an associated flow rule, otherwise it is called non-associated.
The associated flow rule is:

For the associated flow rule, the increments of the plastic strain can only occur in the direction of the normal tensor on the yield surface.
This normal tensor is made up of:

Correspondingly, the associated flow rule is also referred to as a normal rule. If the normalized direction tensor n in equation (2.13) is used:

The plastic multiplier just corresponds to the accumulated plastic strain:

\section{Hardening rule}
The hardening rule describes how the yield surface changes in position and size.
Evolution equations of the back stress tensor allows by the change in position of the kinematic hardening into account.
With this shift in the yield surface, the size and shape of the yield surface remain unchanged.

In material models in which isotropic hardening is depicted, it is done by evolution equations describing an increase in the radius $k$ of the yield surface.
A modeling that represents isotropic hardening is not suitable for cyclic stresses.
In such cases, the yield surface is expanded as far as it finally only purely elastic state occurs (elastic "Shake Down").
The differences of the material models described in the next section consist kinematic hardening only in the respectively used hardening rules to take into account.

\section{Material model}

The characteristics of the material models used for numerical simulations are presented below. The first of the listed material models (after Armstrong / Frederick) is not used in the calculations carried out for this work; the descriptions of the models according to Chaboche and Ohno / Wang are the basic points defined by Armstrong / Frederick. The descriptions provide an overview of the formulation of the relevant development equations under isothermal conditions. The specifics of the implementation of the material models according to Chaboche and Ohno / Wang under thermal transient conditions are discussed in detail by Willuweit [66].

\section{Armstrong and Frederick model}
The Armstrong and Frederick model [7] considered a non-linear kinematic hardening rule.
The evolution equation used in this model for the increment of the back stress tensor is:
\begin{equation}
{\rm{d}}{\bf{a}} = (h_0 \cdot {\bf{n}} - c \cdot {\bf{a}}){\rm{d}} p.
\label{Equ:ArmstrongFrederick}
\end{equation}
$h_0$ corresponds to the initial value of the plastic tangent module, $c$ is a material constant.
Transformation of Equation \ref{Equ:ArmstrongFrederick} leads to:
\begin{equation}
{\rm{d}}{\bf{a}} = c \cdot (r \cdot {\bf{n}} - {\bf{a}}){\rm{d}} p,
\label{Equ:ArmstrongFrederick2}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
r=\frac{h_0}{c}.
\end{equation}
In this representation, $r$ corresponds to a limiting radius for the back stress tensor.
The back stress tensor ${\bf{a}}$ is not permitted to leave the yield surface.
The more the value of ${\bf{a}}$ approaches the boundary radius, the more the value of the plastic tangent module decreases until the stress-strain curve ends in a horizontal.
This hardening rule can be integrated analytically integrated
