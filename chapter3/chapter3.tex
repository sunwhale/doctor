\section{Material specification}
The investigated material is the nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718 in the form of rods of 20mm diameter, which was procured by ThyssenKrupp VDM GmbH.
The rods were solution-treated at 980$^{\circ}$C for one and a half hour then cooled to room temperature by water.
Then they were aged for eight hours at 720$^{\circ}$C, furnace cooled at 56$^{\circ}$C/h to 621$^{\circ}$C, where they were held for eight hours and forced air cooling to room temperature.
The chemical composition of the nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718 in the research is given in Table \ref{Tab:ChemicalCompositionofIN718}.

Microstructure of the heat-treated alloys was characterized by a optical microscope.
A typical optical micrograph is shown in \ref{Fig:MicrostructureofInconel718}.
It was found that the grain size was about 15$\rm{\mu m}$ and in some local regions the grain size distribution was observed to be inhomogeneous.

\section{Specimens and test facilities}
\label{Sec:Specimens}
Uniaxial monotonic tensile and isothermal fatigue tests were performed by using the solid cylindrical specimen.
Its geometry is shown in \ref{Fig:IN718_Axial_Specimen}, a total length of 185mm, a outer diameter of the gauge section of 10mm and 35mm in gauge length.
The outer surface roughness values of $R_a=0.1\rm{\mu m}$.
The advantage of solid specimen is easy to be manufactured.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{IN718_Axial_Specimen.pdf}}
\caption{Dimensions of solid specimen for axial test.}
\label{Fig:IN718_Axial_Specimen}
\end{figure}

All multiaxial fatigue testing specimens were in thin-walled tubular shape.
The thin-walled tubular specimen geometry is shown in \ref{Fig:IN718_Multiaxial_Specimen}, 185mm in the total length, a gauge length of 35mm, a outer diameter of the gage section of 12mm and a inner diameter of the specimen of 10mm.
Thus the wall thickness of the tubular specimen in the gauge section is 1mm.
Advantages of tubular specimens are that they offer a uniform stresses gage length, the stresses can be calculated directly from the applied loads.
Moreover, uniform temperature distributions in the gage length of the tubular specimens are easily achieved by induction heating, since relatively simple shape induction coils can be employed.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{IN718_Multiaxial_Specimen.pdf}}
\caption{Dimensions of tubular specimen for biaxial test.}
\label{Fig:IN718_Multiaxial_Specimen}
\end{figure}

Both solid and thin-walled tubular specimens were designed by taking into the account of the available testing equipments and loading conditions, e.g. the gauge length of the extensometer, the height of the support frame of the extensometer, the height of the furnace and coil, and so on.
The experiments confirmed that the specimen geometry influenced the temperature distribution in the gauge length.
Consequently the final geometries which presented in the above figures were determined by experimental and numerical analysis.
The dimensions of solid and tubular specimens are adapt to the dimension ratios suggested by the standards ASTM E606 \cite{astm1998standard} and E2207 \cite{standard2007e2207}, respectively.
A discussion of different multiaxial testing techniques can be found in Socie (2000) \cite{socie2000multiaxial}.
All specimens were manufactured by a CNC machining center and the surfaces were polished prior to testing.


%Axial and biaxial loading tests were respectively conducted on the solid and thin-walled tubular specimen.
%Dimensions of the specimens are shown in Figure \ref{Fig:IN718_Axial_Specimen} and \ref{Fig:IN718_Multiaxial_Specimen}.
%The dimensions of both type specimens have to fulfill the standards, e.g. ASTM E606 \cite{astm1998standard} and E2207 \cite{standard2007e2207}, and match the extensometer, the furnace height and the induction coil shape.

%Several requirements should be considered to determine the dimensions of the two type specimens.
%Firstly, ASTM E606\cite{astm1998standard} and E2207\cite{standard2007e2207} standards should be fulfilled.
%Secondly, the high temperature extensometers and furnace or induction coil need enough space to be installed.
%Thirdly, we notice that the specimen geometries influence the temperature distribution of the whole specimen.
%Consequently the final geometries are determined by the numerical analysis and temperature measurement.


\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{Equipment.pdf}}
\caption{Induction heating system with biaxial test system MTS809.}
\label{Fig:Equipment}
\end{figure}

Experiments were performed in a servo controlled hydraulic system (MTS 809) with both a electric resistance furnace (MTS 653) and a induction heating system (TruHeat HF 3010).
The system is capable of applying axial and biaxial loads with temperature controlled simultaneously.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.1}{\includegraphics{MTS809.jpg}}
\caption{MTS-809 轴向/扭转复合疲劳材料试验机与感应加热系统.}
\label{Fig:MTS809}
\end{figure} 
Thus, uniaxial and biaxial stress states can be generated under a certain temperature in the gauge length of the specimen.
\ref{Fig:Equipment} shows the induction heating system.
The strains were measured by the high temperature axial and biaxial extensometers which contact the specimen surface with two ceramic rods.
The gauge lengths of the axial and biaxial extensometers are 12mm and 25mm respectively.

The shape of the induction coil influences the temperature distribution of the specimens.
Induction heating efficiency is dependent on the coil density and the distance between the coil and specimen surface.
Concentrated coil density and short distance to the specimen surface result in high heat flux, vice versa.
We need to adjustment the coil to optimize the axial temperature distribution.
The maximum temperature deviations along the 12mm gauge length were $\pm5^{\circ}$C and along the 25mm gauge length were $\pm8^{\circ}$C.



\section{Monotonic tensile tests}
%Monotonic tensile test was conducted in the Testworks software, which is a proprietary software package developed by MTS for the realization of basic standard tests.

Monotonic tensile test is the fundamental material test in which a specimen is subjected to a controlled tension until failure.
The purpose of this portion of the testing program was to develop the Inconel 718 mechanical property data for use in the finite-element calculations.

The isothermal monotonic tensile tests were performed under four temperatures 20$^{\circ}$C, 300$^{\circ}$C, 550$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C.
All tests procedures followed the ASTM standard E21.09.
The heating apparatus was the electric resistance furnace (MTS653).
% and the specimens were in the air at atmospheric pressure.
Temperature was measured by the type K thermocouples which were sufficiently sensitive and reliable.
%The temperature measurement sensor was the type K thermocouple which was sufficiently sensitive and reliable to ensure that the temperature of the specimen is within the limits specified in the gauge length.
At the beginning of each test with force kept constant at zero and the specimen was heated to the set temperature and held on for an hour to ensure the temperature distribution of the specimen became stabilization.
%Before the mechanical tension load applied, all specimens were heated to the set temperature by the resistance furnace and held the temperature for an hour until the temperature distribution of the specimen became to the steady state.
For the duration of each test, the temperature deviations between the indicated and nominal values were less than $\pm3^{\circ}$C.
The tensile tests were performed in strain control at the predetermined strain rate $1.0\times 10^{-4}\rm{s}^{-1}$.
The extensometer was removed after the axial strain reached 6\% and then the tests were changed to displacement control.
The test program is listed in Table \ref{tab:TensionLoadingConditions}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{Monotonic tensile test program.}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    Temperature & Remove point of extensometer  & Strain rate  \\
    \midrule
    20$^{\circ}$C  & $6\%$ & $1.0\times 10^{-4} \rm{s}^{-1}$ \\
    300$^{\circ}$C & $6\%$ & $1.0\times 10^{-4} \rm{s}^{-1}$ \\
    550$^{\circ}$C & $6\%$ & $1.0\times 10^{-4} \rm{s}^{-1}$ \\
    650$^{\circ}$C & $6\%$ & $1.0\times 10^{-4} \rm{s}^{-1}$ \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
  \label{tab:TensionLoadingConditions}%
\end{table}%

%The test process involves placing the specimen in the testing machine, calibrating the zero point of force and extensometer , heating the specimen to the indicated temperature and slowly extending it until it fractures.
%Finally, the specimen was carefully removed and examined.
%During this process, The axial strain rate keeps constant as $1 \times 10^{-4}$s$^{-1}$.
%Extensometer measurement values of the gauge section is recorded against the applied force.
The elongation and force measurements are used to calculate the engineering stress $\sigma_{eng}$ and engineering strain $\varepsilon_{eng}$, using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{eng}=\frac{F}{A_0},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{eng}=\frac{l-l_0}{l_0},
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the axial force, $A_0$ is the specimen initial cross-sectional area, $\Delta l$ is the change of gauge length, $l_0$ and $l$ are the initial and final gauge lengths of the specimen.
Noting that, it is recommended to use true stress $\sigma$ and logarithmic strain $\varepsilon$ in large deformation condition, and they can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma=\sigma_{eng}(1+\varepsilon_{eng}),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon=\ln(1+\varepsilon_{eng}).
\end{equation}

\ref{Fig:IN718_Monotonic_Tension} shows the variation of the Inconel 718 tension stress-strain curves with different test temperatures 20$^{\circ}$C, 300$^{\circ}$C, 550$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C.
The material properties of different temperatures can be determined from the experimental data, e.g. Young's modulus, yield strength, ultimate stress and fracture elongation (see Table \ref{tab:General_material_mechanical_properties}).
There was a considerable decline in Young's modulus, yield strength and ultimate stress with the increase of temperature.
%With the increase of temperature, the Young's modulus, yield strength shows a certain decline.
However, the fracture elongation was insensitivity with the temperature.
As a result, the material still retains reasonable strength at 650$^{\circ}$C.

\section{Isothermal LCF tests}
Both uniaxial and multiaxial strain controlled isothermal low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were performed in air by the MTS-809 axial/torsional testing machine.
The machine was equipped with the inductive heating device and the temperatures were measured and controlled by thermocouples wrapped around the specimen surface at the center of the gauge section of the specimen.

\subsection{Uniaxial fatigue tests}
The uniaxial fatigue tests include tension-compression tests and pure torsion tests which are performed by solid and tubular specimens respectively.
The dimensions of solid and tubular specimens are discussed in Section \ref{Sec:Specimens} and shown in \ref{Fig:IN718_Axial_Specimen} and \ref{Fig:IN718_Multiaxial_Specimen}.

All tests were carried out in accordance to the requirements of ASTM standard E606.
At the beginning of each test with force kept constant at zero and the specimen was heated to the set temperature and held on for an hour to ensure the temperature distribution of the specimen became stabilized.
For the duration of each test, the temperature deviations between the indicated and nominal values were less than $\pm3^{\circ}$C.
Isothermal uniaxial tests were carried out using an $R_{\varepsilon}$ ratio ($\varepsilon_{\min}/\varepsilon_{\max}$) of -1.
All uniaxial fatigue tests were performed in strain control.
A triangular waveform was applied at a prescribed frequency of 0.05Hz over the strain range of $\pm 0.6\%$ to $\pm 1.0\%$.
Therefore, the strain rates were below $1.0\times 10^{-3}\rm{s}^{-1}$ for all tests.
All uniaxial fatigue tests were performed at the temperature range of 300$^{\circ}$C to 650$^{\circ}$C.
Failure was deemed to have occurred if the peak load dropped 15\% from the stabilized peak.

All tests were stopped once 30,000 cycles had been reached. 
Such tests are marked on graphs with a horizontal arrow.

performed in total strain control by the MTS Multipurpose software (MPE).




Preliminary tests were conducted to ensure that effects of frequency or strain rate with respect to fatigue life, stress response, and temperature were negligible for the range of frequencies used in this study.

For the first 100 cycles of each test, 200 data per cycle acquisition rate was settled.
After that, 50-100 data per cycle for selected cycles in order to reduce the stored file size.
In this work, 20\% load drop compared with the maximum load value was defined as failure criterion.
This load change corresponded to the presence of multiple macro cracks with several millimeters lengthes.
The peak εmax and valley εmin value of the strain were given to the controlling software.
The default peak and valley compensation method was used to obtain an accurate feedback value.

Stress-strain response and the peak/valley stresses were observed during the test procedure.

\subsection{Multiaxial fatigue tests}
Multiaxial tests involved simultaneous axial and torsional loading with the prescribed phase relationship.
The test procedure was adapt to the standard ASTM E2207-15 which deals with strain-controlled, axial, torsional, and combined in-phase and out-of-phase axial torsional fatigue testing with thin-walled, circular cross-section, tubular specimens at isothermal, ambient and elevated temperatures.
Some concepts are defined as follows:

Axial strain $\varepsilon$, refers to engineering axial strain, and is defined as change in length divided by the original length $\Delta L_g/L_g$.

Shear strain $\gamma$, refers to engineering shear strain, resulting from the application of a torsional moment to a cylindrical specimen.
Such a torsional shear strain is simple shear and is defined similar to axial strain with the exception that the shearing displacement, $\Delta L_s$ is perpendicular to rather than parallel to the gage length, $L_g$, that is, $\gamma=\Delta L_s/L_g$.
%$\gamma$ is related to the angles of twist, $\theta$ and $\Psi$ as follows: $\gamma=\tan \Psi$
As shown in \ref{Fig:Shear_Strain}, $\Psi$ is the angle of twist along the gage length of the cylindrical specimen, $\theta$ expressed in radians is the angle of twist between the planes defining the gage length of the cylindrical specimen.
$\theta$ is measurable directly as angle using specially calibrated torsional extensometers.
Thus, we have $\gamma = (d/2)\theta/ L_g$.
Biaxial strain amplitude ratio $\lambda$, is defined as the ratio of the shear strain amplitude $\gamma_a$ to the axial strain amplitude $\varepsilon_a$, that is, $\gamma_a/\varepsilon_a$.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{Shear_Strain.pdf}}
\caption{Twisted gage section of a cylindrical specimen due to a torsional moment.}
\label{Fig:Shear_Strain}
\end{figure}

Axial stress $\sigma$, refers to the engineering stress, which is the ratio of force, $F$, to specimen original cross sectional area, A, that is, $\sigma=F/A$.

Shear stress $\tau$, refers to engineering shear stress, acting in the orthogonal tangential and axial directions of the gage section and is a result of the applied torsional moment, (Torque) $T$, to the thin-walled tubular specimen. The shear stress, like the shear strain, is always the greatest at the outer diameter. Under elastic loading conditions, shear stress also varies linearly through the thin wall of the tubular specimen. However, under elasto-plastic loading conditions, shear stress tends to vary in a nonlinear fashion. Most strain-controlled axial-torsional fatigue tests are conducted under elasto-plastic loading conditions. Therefore, assumption of a uniformly distributed shear stress is recommended. The relationship between such a shear stress applied at the mean diameter of the gage section and the torsional moment, $T$, is
\begin{equation}
\tau=\frac{16T}{\pi(d_o^2-d_i^2)(d_o+d_i)},
\end{equation}
where, $\tau$ is the shear stress, $d_o$ and $d_i$ are the outer and inner diameters of the tubular test specimen, respectively.

The experimental program consisted of axial, torsional and non-proportional cyclic tests with temperature range from 300$^{\circ}$C to 650$^{\circ}$C.
%All experiments are strain controlled and the stress-strain hysteresis loops were recorded for each cycles.
The loading conditions for each type of tests are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Loading-Conditions}.
Strain path, is defined as the combination of axial strain $\varepsilon$ and shear strain $\gamma$ in a cycle under the biaxial loaded strain-controlled conditions. Such as uniaxial strain path (\ref{Fig:LoadPath}(a)), proportional strain path (\ref{Fig:LoadPath}(b)) and non-proportional strain path (\ref{Fig:LoadPath}(c,d)).

In this section we will introduce the multiaxial thermomechanical fatigue testing process.
As the name implies the multiaxial thermomechanical fatigue testing is combined with the multiaxial mechanical testing and thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) testing.
\section{Thermomechanical fatigue testing}
Thermomechanical fatigue testing is a variant of fatigue testing designed to simulate real-world service conditions of engineered components.
Specifically, TMF tests characterize the response of materials to both cyclic mechanical loading and fluctuating temperature, which produce a synergistic response that may not be well-predicted with isothermal fatigue testing.
TMF tests are most frequently conducted on high-temperature alloys used injet engines, using a combination of in-phase and out-of-phase mechanical and thermal cycling.

ASTM E2368-10 is the standard practice for thermomechanical fatigue testing under uniaxially loaded strain-controlled conditions.
Unfortunately we do not have a standard for the TMF testing under biaxial loaded strain-controlled conditions.
According to the standard, a thermomechanical fatigue cycle is here defined as a condition where uniform temperature and strain fields over the specimen gage section are simultaneously varied and independently controlled.
Some concepts are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Coefficient of thermal expansion} $\alpha$, the fractional change in free expansion strain for a unit change in temperature, as measured on the test specimen.
  \item \textbf{Thermal strain} $\varepsilon_{th}$, the strain component resulting from a change in temperature under free expansion conditions.
  \[\varepsilon_{th}=\alpha\Delta T\]
  \item \textbf{Mechanical strain} $\varepsilon_{m}$, the strain component resulting when the free expansion thermal strain specimen is subtracted from the total strain.
  \item \textbf{Total strain} $\varepsilon_t$, the strain component measured on the test specimen, and is the sum of the thermal strain and the mechanical strain.
  \[\varepsilon_t=\varepsilon_m+\varepsilon_{th}\]
  \item \textbf{Strain ratio} $R_{\varepsilon}$, the ratio of minimum mechanical strain to the maximum mechanical strain in a strain cycle.
  \[R_{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon_{m,min}/\varepsilon_{m,max}\]
  \item \textbf{Mechanical strain/temperature phase angle} $\varphi$, for the purpose of assessing phasing accuracy, this is defined as the waveform shift (expressed in degrees) between the maximum temperature response as measured on the specimen and the maximum mechanical strain response. For reference purpose, the angle $\varphi$ is considered positive if the temperature response maximum leads the mechanical strain response maximum by $180^\circ$ or less, otherwise the phase angle is considered to be negative.
      The phase $\varphi$ between temperature and mechanical strain can be chosen between $-180^\circ$ and $180^\circ$.
      One of the special case is $\varphi=0^\circ$ where the maximum and minimum of temperature and strain are reached at the same time. This is called in-phase TMF.
      The other special case is $\varphi=180^\circ$ where the maximum value of temperature leads the maximum value of mechanical strain by a time value equal to $1/2$ the cycle period. This is called out-of-phase (anti-phase) TMF.
      As shown in \ref{Fig:Thermomechanical_phase}, the vertical coordinates are strain $\varepsilon$ and temperature T.

%\subsection{1}
%Experiments are conducted on the MTS model 809 axial/torsional servohydraulic testing system.
%% with the model 647 hydraulic wedge grips.
%The system can provide the maximum axial load to 250kN and the maximum torque to 2200N$\cdot$m.
%The controller of our test system is the FlexTest Models 40 Controller.
%It provides real-time closed-loop control, with transducer conditioning and function generation to drive various types of servoactuators.
%The FlexTest 40 Controller consists of the Model 494.04 chassis and a computer workstation that runs MTS controller applications.
%
%The Model 494.04 Chassis includes three VMEbus(Versa Module Europa bus) slots as shown in \ref{Fig:Typical_Model_494_Chassis_Connections}.
%Slot 1 is processor board which provides PIDF(Proportional, Integral, Derivative, Feed forward) processing and it is an interface between the controller and the computer workstation.
%Slots 2, 3 are I/O carrier which support up to four mezzanine cards that can condition transducers, drive servovalves, provide A-to-D inputs, and interface to various digital transducers (such as encoders and Temposonics transducers).
%Slots 4, 5 are system board which provides control of the test system hydraulics, including hydraulic power unit (HPU) and hydraulic service manifold (HSM) control.
