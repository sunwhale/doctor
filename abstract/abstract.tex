Mechanical parts in aero engines are loaded by both mechanical loading and thermal loading simultaneously. Experiments revealed that the mechanical behavior as well as fatigue performance of the material depend on amplitudes and the phase angle of the thermo-mechanical loads. Description of the interdependence of the loads is one of the most intensively investigated topics in aero engine structures. In the present work, extensive experiments are performed for a nickel-based superalloy under both iso-thermal and thermo-mechanical loading conditions. Furthermore, fatigue tests reveal that the thermomechanical loading reduces fatigue life of the material significantly. Based on experimental data a thermomechanical loading parameter is introduced to assess TMF fatigue failure. The TMF fatigue life can be calibrated based on the present concept reasonably.
