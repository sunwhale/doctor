%This thesis has presented computational results of heat transfer in a heated multiple cavity rig with axial-flow-through.
%The rig comprised an encased rotor with two internal cavities from a typical compressor disc-shroud stack and a central shaft.
%The inlet and rotating conditions are $Re_z$ up to $1.4 \times 10^5$ and $Re_{\phi}$ up to $1.53 \times 10^7$.
%Conclusions are dependent on the computational results:

%    \item \textbf{Pressure distribution. }Air pressure in the rotating cavities increases with the normalized radial coordinate and it is a linear relation between the pressure and radial coordinate. A pressure coefficient is suggested to describe the pressure distribution.
%        The pressure coefficient, which is assumed by pressure and radial coordinate, grows squarely with the rotational Reynolds number.
%        Gap ratio influences the pressure coefficient.
%        With increasing of gap ratio, the pressure coefficient decreases.
%        However, the pressure coefficient is insensible with discs' thickness.
%    \item \textbf{Average Nusselt number of disc. }Average Nusselt number from the inner surface of the disc has a linear relation with the square root of rotational Reynolds number.
%        Results with different rotational Reynolds numbers but the fixed inlet speed and gap ratio are chosen to determine the relation.
%        Comparison of the results with different gap ratios shows that geometry effect of the average Nusselt number is not evident.
%        Generally with increasing of gap ratio, the average Nusselt number from disc decreases.
%        The small gap ratio relates to the reduction of convective heat transfer.
%        Average Nusselt number from disc also has a relation with Rossby number.
%        Quotient of average Nusselt number and rotational Reynolds number is a linear function of Rossby number.
%    \item \textbf{Local Nusselt number of disc. }The expression of local Nusselt number is suggested.
%        The local Nusselt number from the inner surface of the disk is suggested as a function of rotational Reynolds number, axial Reynolds number, local temperature and radial coordinate.
%        Parameters of the expression are determined by the computational results.
%        The expression can be used to estimate the discs' convective heat transfer coefficient.
%    \item \textbf{Average Nusselt number of shroud. }Average Nusselt number from the inner surface of cavities' shroud shows a linear relation with rotational Reynolds number.
%        Gap ratio influences the linear relation.
%        As the gap ratio becomes larger, the slope of the linear relation increases.
%    \item \textbf{Prediction of temperature. }Comprising with the experimental data, CFD and FEM computations shows that the suggested thermal model can estimate good temperature prediction of rotating axial-flow-through cavities.
%        With the expression of local Nusselt number, the convective heat transfer coefficients are calculated.
%        The convective heat transfer coefficients are used as the boundary conditions of the inner surface of the cavities in the structural thermal computations.
%        The difference between the results of FEM and CFD simulations is less than $\pm 3\%$.

%Further experimental and numerical study is needed to improve the prediction of the complex flow and heat transfer in the heated rotating cavities with axial-through-flow. Transient simulation is needed to study the transient heat transfer behavior instead of the steady state simulation.
