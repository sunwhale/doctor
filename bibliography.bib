abstract = {The following contribution deals with the growth of cracks in low-cycle fatigue (LCF) and thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) tested specimens of Inconel 718 measured by using the replica method. The specimens are loaded with different strain rates. The material shows a significantly higher crack growth rate if the strain rate is decreased. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is adopted to identify the failure mechanism and the misorientation relationship of failed grain boundaries in secondary cracks. The analyzed cracks propagated mainly transgranular but also intergranular failure can be observed in some areas. It is found that grain boundaries with coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundary structure are generally less susceptible for intergranular failure than grain boundaries with random misorientation. For modeling the experimentally identified crack behavior an existing model for fatigue crack growth based on the mechanism of time dependent elastic–plastic crack tip blunting is enhanced to describe environmental effects based on the mechanism of oxygen diffusion at the crack tip. For the diffusion process the temperature dependent parabolic diffusion law is assumed. As a result, the time dependent cyclic crack tip opening displacement ($\Delta$CTOD) is used as representative value to describe both mechanisms. Thus, most of the included model parameters characterize the deformation behavior of the material and can be determined by independent material tests. With the determined material properties, the proposed model describes the experimentally measured crack growth curves very well. The model is validated based on predictions of the number of cycles to failure of LCF as well as in-phase and out-of-phase TMF tests in the temperature range between room temperature and 650°C.},

abstract="The cyclic stress-strain response and the low cycle fatigue life of conventionally heat treated Inconel 718 were studied. Fully reversed strain-controlled tests were performed at room temperature and at 823 K. Optical and electron microscopy were used to study the development of deformation and cracking during cycling. A power-law relationship between life-time and plastic strain amplitude was obtained. A substantial decrease in fatigue life occurred as the temperature was increased from 298 to 823 K and as the cycling frequency was lowered from 3 cyclesJmin to 0.3 cyclesJmin at 823 K. At 298 K, for all the strain amplitudes investigated, an initial rapid hardening was followed by softening, while at 823 K only softening occurred. Electron microscopy showed that the precipitates were sheared in the course of cyclic straining and that plastic deformation proceeded by the propagation of planar bands. These bands were identified as twins. Twinning was found to be more abundant at elevated temperatures than at room temperature, especially at lower frequencies. Cracking was generally initiated along the interfaces between these twin bands and the matrix but, at elevated temperatures and low strain rates, intercrystalline cracking took place, as well. The influence of particles shearing and twinning on the cyclic stress-strain response of the material are discussed. The importance of planar deformation and twinning on intergranular cracking is emphasized.",

abstract = {The critical plane approach is applied to model material fatigue behavior under any constant amplitude proportional loading. The most critical plane and the largest damage parameter are determined in closed form for six damage criteria that have been proposed in the literature. The correct procedures of utilizing these closed-form solutions to construct the damage parameter versus fatigue life curve are outlined. It is shown that the common practice of characterizing the material's fatigue behavior by plotting the damage parameter evaluated on the maximum shear plane against the observed fatigue life violates the principle of the critical plane approach, a problem which can arise during the calibration of any biaxial type of damage criterion. The study emphasizes that the critical plane approach should be consistently applied to both the initial calibration and the subsequent fatigue analysis.},

The components of this modified parameter consist of the maximum shear strain amplitude and the maximum normal stress on the maximum shear strain amplitude plane. Additional cyclic hardening developed during out-of-phase loading is included in the normal stress term. Also, the mathematical formulation of this new parameter is such that variable amplitude loading can be accommodated. Experimental results from tubular specimens made of 1045 HR steel under in-phase and 90 degree out-of-phase axial-torsional straining using both sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave forms were correlated within a factor of about two employing this approach. Available Inconel 718 axial-torsional data including mean strain histories were also satisfactorily correlated using the aforementioned parameter.},

The thermodynamic framework from which the third approach is derived and the conditions of varying temperature are considered. Connections between the three kinds of models are pointed out. Also, some specific rules to describe cyclic hardening or cyclic softening of the material are proposed. Finally, the limits of the models considered, and the difficulties associated with their practical use and their implementation in computer codes are discussed in detail. "

One of the unsolved difficulties concerns the problem of ratchetting, that is, the progressive strain accumulation, cycle-by-cycle, induced by the superposition of a cyclic secondary load to a constant primary load (the mean-stress in the tension-compression case). This paper consider several special kinematic hardening rules and their properties in tension-compression. One particular rule is selected which offers a good compromise, describing both the shape of the normal cyclic stress-strain relations and the ratchetting results. A complete model is then developed including isotropic hardening, which describes fairly well the monotonic, cyclic and ratchetting behaviour of type 316 L stainless steel at room temperature. "

The motivation is twofold. First, the goal of tailoring the material microstructure to control plastic deformation and related failure processes is of great economic importance. Product development cycles have become so short that traditional empirical approaches to alloy modification are noncompetitive in the global marketplace. Second, materials selection and design for durability, which rests upon our understanding of phenomena occurring at microstructural scales as well as at the scale of structural components, is of critical importance as we head into an era where an extensive infrastructure must be maintained. Cost constraints on new systems dictate much more quantitative design and analysis procedures than in the past. Research needs are discussed in a number of key areas involving experiments and modeling, including: experiments conducted at multiple length scales of resolution; principles for multiscale modeling and scale effects in plasticity; coupling of plasticity-induced damage with texture and phase transformations; progressive cyclic deformation and failure; microstructure-scale plasticity of cast alloys and low symmetry polycrystals; and employment of massively parallel computing to determine model parameters and forms of evolution equations for internal structure variables.

Each new model is thus subjected to no incompatibility of rate type formulation for elastic behaviour with the notion of elasticity, as encountered by any other existing Eulerian rate type model for elastoplasticity or hypoelasticity. As particular cases, new Prandtl-Reuss equations for elastic-perfect plasticity and elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening, respectively, are presented for computational and practical purposes. Of them, the equations for kinematic hardening and combined isotropic每kinematic hardening are, respectively, reduced to three uncoupled equations with respect to the spherical stress component, the shifted stress and the back-stress. The effects of finite rotation on the current strain and stress and hardening behaviour are indicated in a clear and direct manner. As illustrations, finite simple shear responses for the proposed models are studied by means of numerical integration. Further, it is proved that, among all possible (infinitely many) objective Eulerian rate type models, the proposed models are not only the first, but unique, self-consistent models of their kinds, in the sense that the rate type equation used to represent elastic behaviour is exactly integrable to really deliver an elastic relation. ?

It is assumed that isotropic, as well as kinematic, hardening consists of several parts, and that each part of isotropic hardening evolves when the corresponding part of kinematic hardening is in the critical state of dynamic recovery. The extended model is capable of simulating the cyclic hardening behavior in which different characteristics of cyclic hardening appear depending on strain range. The model is verified by simulating the relatively large cyclic straining tests of 304 stainless steel at ambient temperature, in which cyclic hardening does not stabilize before rupture if strain range exceeds a certain value. The model is further verified by predicting the history dependence of cyclic hardening under incremental cyclic loading and the maximum plastic strain dependence of strain hardening in cyclic tension.

These rules have a feature that only the projection of plastic strain rate into the direction of back stress contributes to the dynamic recovery. They are in contrast with the other rules in which either/both accumulated plastic strain rate or/and plastic strain rate enters into the dynamic recovery term. In this paper, another feature, which has not been investigated by Abdel-Karim and Ohno, is introduced. Discussing this feature, characterized by decomposition of back stress into radial and tangential components, a numerical integration method based on radial-return mapping using radial components only is developed. This method consists of a trial predictor and final corrector depending on the current state of back stress and plastic strain increment. The applicability of the method is examined carefully and critically. It is shown that this method is effective and its accuracy is indistinguishable to the radial-return method for elastic-perfectly plastic materials. "

This new set of data reiterated Aubin and her coworkers＊ observation and illustrated many new responses critical to model development and validation. Two recent and different classes of cyclic plasticity models, the modified Chaboche model proposed by Bari and Hassan and the version of the multi-mechanism model proposed by Taleb and Cailletaud, are evaluated in terms of their simulations of the \{SS304L\} non-proportional ratcheting responses. A modeling scheme for non-proportional ratcheting responses using the kinematic hardening rule parameters in addition to the conventionally used isotropic hardening rule parameter (yield surface size change) in the modified Chaboche model is evaluated. Strengths and weaknesses of the models in simulating the non-proportional ratcheting responses are identified. Further improvements of these models needed for improving the non-proportional ratcheting simulations are suggested in the paper. "

The model is extended by taking into account isotropic hardening depending on accumulated plastic strain. It is assumed that isotropic hardening will be associated with kinematic hardening in the governing equations where activation of either isotropic or kinematic hardening is controlled through a specific controller parameter 百. The accuracy of simulations can be adjusted by changing the value of this controller parameter. It is shown that such an extension is effective and restrains activation of dynamic recovery resulting in less accumulated ratchetting strain with large values of the controller parameter. In addition, it is shown that the extended model simulates multiaxial ratchetting experiments conducted on \{SS\} 304L by Hassan et?al. fairly well. "

In the proposed model, a new fading memory stress function has been introduced in the recovery term of the kinematic hardening rule to simulate the cyclic hardening behavior of the material under strain controlled loading cycles. Evolution of the yield stress during cyclic plastic deformation process has been introduced through exponential function of accumulated plastic strain. The present formulation has demonstrated the non Masing behavior and cyclic hardening characteristic of \{SA333\} C每Mn steel material similar to the experimental observations. A number of experiments have been performed to investigate the \{LCF\} and ratcheting characteristics of the material. Material constants are derived from the experimental data. In the present paper, \{LCF\} and ratcheting phenomena have been simulated by developing a \{FEM\} model with axisymmetric round specimen and the new cyclic plasticity formulations have been incorporated in the material model. The fading memory stress function, which is dependent on the loading history, leads to better realization of cyclic hardening and ratcheting phenomenon in the transient cycles as observed from the simulation and experimental results.

abstract = "The article is mainly concerned with time-independent plasticity in the range of cyclic loadings. Three different approaches are considered for the description of kinematic behaviour: (i) the use of independent multiyield surfaces, (ii) models with two surfaces only, (iii) the so-called ¡°nonlinear-kinematic hardening rule¡± defined by a differential equation. The thermodynamic framework from which the third approach is derived and the conditions of varying temperature are considered. Connections between the three kinds of models are pointed out. Also, some specific rules to describe cyclic hardening or cyclic softening of the material are proposed. Finally, the limits of the models considered, and the difficulties associated with their practical use and their implementation in computer codes are discussed in detail. "

The investigation was performed in a two-year, six-task, combined experimental and analytical program. The path-independent integrals for application to time-dependent crack growth were critically reviewed. The crack growth was simulated using a finite element method. The path-independent integrals were computed from the results of finite-element analyses. The ability of these integrals to correlate experimental crack growth data were evaluated under various loading and temperature conditions. The results indicate that some of these integrals are viable parameters for crack growth prediction at elevated temperatures.}, author={Kim, K.S. and Vanstone, R.H.}, year={1992}, month={Dec}}

abstract = "The constitutive modeling of cyclic plasticity has made great progress durinr the past 20 years. One of the unsolved difficulties concerns the problem of ratchetting, that is, the progressive strain accumulation, cycle-by-cycle, induced by the superposition of a cyclic secondary load to a constant primary load (the mean-stress in the tension-compression case). This paper consider several special kinematic hardening rules and their properties in tension-compression. One particular rule is selected which offers a good compromise, describing both the shape of the normal cyclic stress-strain relations and the ratchetting results. A complete model is then developed including isotropic hardening, which describes fairly well the monotonic, cyclic and ratchetting behaviour of type 316 L stainless steel at room temperature. "

abstract = "We focus on challenges in advancing the modeling of plastic flow processes to incorporate distinct characteristics of various length scales within materials and structures. The motivation is twofold. First, the goal of tailoring the material microstructure to control plastic deformation and related failure processes is of great economic importance. Product development cycles have become so short that traditional empirical approaches to alloy modification are noncompetitive in the global marketplace. Second, materials selection and design for durability, which rests upon our understanding of phenomena occurring at microstructural scales as well as at the scale of structural components, is of critical importance as we head into an era where an extensive infrastructure must be maintained. Cost constraints on new systems dictate much more quantitative design and analysis procedures than in the past. Research needs are discussed in a number of key areas involving experiments and modeling, including: experiments conducted at multiple length scales of resolution; principles for multiscale modeling and scale effects in plasticity; coupling of plasticity-induced damage with texture and phase transformations; progressive cyclic deformation and failure; microstructure-scale plasticity of cast alloys and low symmetry polycrystals; and employment of massively parallel computing to determine model parameters and forms of evolution equations for internal structure variables.

Comparisons with multilayer and multisurface models are made also, resulting in a finding that the simple one in the present rules is similar to the multilayer model with total strain rate replaced by inelastic (or plastic) strain rate.

abstract = "The objective of this article is to suggest new Eulerian rate type constitutive models for isotropic finite deformation elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening etc. The main novelty of the suggested models is the use of the newly discovered logarithmic stress rate and the incorporation of a simple, natural explicit integrable-exactly rate type formulation of general hyperelasticity. Each new model is thus subjected to no incompatibility of rate type formulation for elastic behaviour with the notion of elasticity, as encountered by any other existing Eulerian rate type model for elastoplasticity or hypoelasticity. As particular cases, new Prandtl-Reuss equations for elastic-perfect plasticity and elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening, respectively, are presented for computational and practical purposes. Of them, the equations for kinematic hardening and combined isotropicšCkinematic hardening are, respectively, reduced to three uncoupled equations with respect to the spherical stress component, the shifted stress and the back-stress. The effects of finite rotation on the current strain and stress and hardening behaviour are indicated in a clear and direct manner. As illustrations, finite simple shear responses for the proposed models are studied by means of numerical integration. Further, it is proved that, among all possible (infinitely many) objective Eulerian rate type models, the proposed models are not only the first, but unique, self-consistent models of their kinds, in the sense that the rate type equation used to represent elastic behaviour is exactly integrable to really deliver an elastic relation. ?

abstract = {An experimental program has been implemented to determine small offset yield loci under axial-torsional loading at elevated temperatures. The nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718) was chosen for study due to its common use in aeropropulsion applications. Initial and subsequent yield loci were determined for solutioned IN718 at 23, 371, and 454 C and for aged (precipitation hardened) IN718 at 23 and 649 C. The shape of the initial yield loci for solutioned and aged IN718 agreed well with the von Mises prediction. However, in general, the centers of initial yield loci were eccentric to the origin due to a strength-differential (S-D) effect that increased with temperature. Subsequent yield loci exhibited anisotropic hardening in the form of translation and distortion of the locus. This work shows that it is possible to determine yield surfaces for metallic materials at temperatures up to at least 649 C using multiple probes of a single specimen. The experimental data is first-of-its-kind for a superalloy at these very high temperatures and will facilitate a better understanding of multiaxial material response, eventually leading to improved design tools for engine designers.},

It is assumed that isotropic, as well as kinematic, hardening consists of several parts, and that each part of isotropic hardening evolves when the corresponding part of kinematic hardening is in the critical state of dynamic recovery. The extended model is capable of simulating the cyclic hardening behavior in which different characteristics of cyclic hardening appear depending on strain range. The model is verified by simulating the relatively large cyclic straining tests of 304 stainless steel at ambient temperature, in which cyclic hardening does not stabilize before rupture if strain range exceeds a certain value. The model is further verified by predicting the history dependence of cyclic hardening under incremental cyclic loading and the maximum plastic strain dependence of strain hardening in cyclic tension.

These rules have a feature that only the projection of plastic strain rate into the direction of back stress contributes to the dynamic recovery. They are in contrast with the other rules in which either/both accumulated plastic strain rate or/and plastic strain rate enters into the dynamic recovery term. In this paper, another feature, which has not been investigated by Abdel-Karim and Ohno, is introduced. Discussing this feature, characterized by decomposition of back stress into radial and tangential components, a numerical integration method based on radial-return mapping using radial components only is developed. This method consists of a trial predictor and final corrector depending on the current state of back stress and plastic strain increment. The applicability of the method is examined carefully and critically. It is shown that this method is effective and its accuracy is indistinguishable to the radial-return method for elastic-perfectly plastic materials. "

A modeling scheme for non-proportional ratcheting responses using the kinematic hardening rule parameters in addition to the conventionally used isotropic hardening rule parameter (yield surface size change) in the modified Chaboche model is evaluated. Strengths and weaknesses of the models in simulating the non-proportional ratcheting responses are identified. Further improvements of these models needed for improving the non-proportional ratcheting simulations are suggested in the paper. "

The model is extended by taking into account isotropic hardening depending on accumulated plastic strain. It is assumed that isotropic hardening will be associated with kinematic hardening in the governing equations where activation of either isotropic or kinematic hardening is controlled through a specific controller parameter ŠÊ. The accuracy of simulations can be adjusted by changing the value of this controller parameter. It is shown that such an extension is effective and restrains activation of dynamic recovery resulting in less accumulated ratchetting strain with large values of the controller parameter.

It is applicable to isotropic metals subjected to arbitrary thermomechanical loading conditions at small strains. The focus of the model formulation is its validity for the full range of thermal and mechanical loading conditions to be covered in an industrial context by e.g. modern aero-engine designs. Consequently, the proposed model describes the material behavior on a macroscopic level covering the full temperature range from room temperature to the upper application limit under monotonic as well as cyclic loading. Special emphasis is also put on the correct representation of the observed ratcheting behavior. The most prominent features of the model are the combined treatment of both, rate dependent, as well as rate independent inelasticity through a limit surface concept, the description of primary, secondary and tertiary creep behavior and the application of an appropriate backstress evolution equation. A fully implicit integration algorithm for the proposed model is developed and implemented in connection with uniaxial integration point drivers as well as three alternative Finite Element packages. The parameters of the proposed model can be identified based on a limited number of complex cyclic tests and monotonic creep tests. After reporting on the fitting results for such tests for the Nickel-base superalloy \{IN718\} the predictive capabilities of the proposed model are assessed for a number of isothermal and nonisothermal tests. Finally, the performance of the algorithmic implementation into the Finite Element packages is briefly addressed. "

In the proposed model, a new fading memory stress function has been introduced in the recovery term of the kinematic hardening rule to simulate the cyclic hardening behavior of the material under strain controlled loading cycles. Evolution of the yield stress during cyclic plastic deformation process has been introduced through exponential function of accumulated plastic strain. The present formulation has demonstrated the non Masing behavior and cyclic hardening characteristic of \{SA333\} CšCMn steel material similar to the experimental observations. A number of experiments have been performed to investigate the \{LCF\} and ratcheting characteristics of the material. Material constants are derived from the experimental data. In the present paper, \{LCF\} and ratcheting phenomena have been simulated by developing a \{FEM\} model with axisymmetric round specimen and the new cyclic plasticity formulations have been incorporated in the material model. The fading memory stress function, which is dependent on the loading history, leads to better realization of cyclic hardening and ratcheting phenomenon in the transient cycles as observed from the simulation and experimental results.

abstract = "The objective of this article is to suggest new Eulerian rate type constitutive models for isotropic finite deformation elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening etc. The main novelty of the suggested models is the use of the newly discovered logarithmic stress rate and the incorporation of a simple, natural explicit integrable-exactly rate type formulation of general hyperelasticity. Each new model is thus subjected to no incompatibility of rate type formulation for elastic behaviour with the notion of elasticity, as encountered by any other existing Eulerian rate type model for elastoplasticity or hypoelasticity. As particular cases, new Prandtl-Reuss equations for elastic-perfect plasticity and elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening, respectively, are presented for computational and practical purposes. Of them, the equations for kinematic hardening and combined isotropicšCkinematic hardening are, respectively, reduced to three uncoupled equations with respect to the spherical stress component, the shifted stress and the back-stress. The effects of finite rotation on the current strain and stress and hardening behaviour are indicated in a clear and direct manner. As illustrations, finite simple shear responses for the proposed models are studied by means of numerical integration. Further, it is proved that, among all possible (infinitely many) objective Eulerian rate type models, the proposed models are not only the first, but unique, self-consistent models of their kinds, in the sense that the rate type equation used to represent elastic behaviour is exactly integrable to really deliver an elastic relation. ?

abstract = {The following contribution deals with the growth of cracks in low-cycle fatigue (LCF) and thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) tested specimens of Inconel 718 measured by using the replica method. The specimens are loaded with different strain rates. The material shows a significantly higher crack growth rate if the strain rate is decreased. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is adopted to identify the failure mechanism and the misorientation relationship of failed grain boundaries in secondary cracks. The analyzed cracks propagated mainly transgranular but also intergranular failure can be observed in some areas. It is found that grain boundaries with coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundary structure are generally less susceptible for intergranular failure than grain boundaries with random misorientation. For modeling the experimentally identified crack behavior an existing model for fatigue crack growth based on the mechanism of time dependent elastic–plastic crack tip blunting is enhanced to describe environmental effects based on the mechanism of oxygen diffusion at the crack tip. For the diffusion process the temperature dependent parabolic diffusion law is assumed. As a result, the time dependent cyclic crack tip opening displacement ($\Delta$CTOD) is used as representative value to describe both mechanisms. Thus, most of the included model parameters characterize the deformation behavior of the material and can be determined by independent material tests. With the determined material properties, the proposed model describes the experimentally measured crack growth curves very well. The model is validated based on predictions of the number of cycles to failure of LCF as well as in-phase and out-of-phase TMF tests in the temperature range between room temperature and 650°C.},

abstract = {The axial, strain-controlled, cyclic fatigue behavior of direct age alloy 718 is investigated. Ramberg-Osgood (R-O) cyclic stress-cyclic strain relationships were determined at each temperature. The results were used to assess the fatigue life as functions of the R-O alternating plastic strain and R-O alternating stress. As temperature decreased, a departure from Coffin-Manson behavior was observed. The fatigue lives at 149, 315 and 454 °C, plotted as a function of the R-O alternating stress, converge when superimposed and a crossover in the responses is observed. Under fixed alternating stress conditions, the fatigue life below the crossover increases as the temperature increases whilst above, a reversion in the fatigue life temperature dependence is seen. A mechanistic model is proposed which seeks to rationalize the increase in fatigue life, as a function of increasing test temperature, to a thermally activated process that mitigates the generation of substructure defects associated with grain boundary stress concentrations. The model activation energy and activation volume are interpreted to substantiate a mechanism whereby a diffusive flux, away from grain boundary stress concentrations, is enabled by the non-conservative motion of grain boundary dislocations in a grain boundary plane containing obstacles. The model predictions are in reasonable agreement with experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The fatigue life is treated as a thermally activated process. An apparent activation energy and apparent activation volume are derived by considering the external work applied and energy stored in the material due to interactions between dislocations and pinning obstacles. A fatigue life relationship is developed and compared to the experimental fatigue behavior. The experimental behavior is adequately explained by the model. The model physical parameters are related to the thermophysical and microstructural properties of each alloy system examined. The variation in fatigue life is also examined based on the microstructure sensitive model parameters. It is proposed that thermal activation enhances fatigue life by reducing stress concentrations responsible for the generation of substructure defects at a critical stress level below where mechanical damage dominates fatigue life. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Stress-controlled thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) behavior of IN 718 superalloy with different concentrations of boron (B) and carbon (C) was studied with temperature varying between 350 and 650 °C at different cyclic stress ranges and at a stress ratio of R = 0.1. Initial cyclic softening followed by a significant cyclic hardening was observed in the in-phase (IP) TMF, while continuous cyclic hardening occurred during out-of-phase (OP) TMF. Tensile cyclic creep was observed in all the TMF deformation regimes, and the creep strain increased with increasing number of cycles and stress range. B and C additions were found to retard the cyclic creep, leading to an effective improvement in the fatigue life of IP-TMF. Among the four alloys tested, the alloy with 29 ppm B and 225 ppm C exhibited the lowest creep strain and the highest IP-TMF life at the lower stress range. In the OP-TMF, the fatigue life increased with increasing B concentration at the higher stress range, and with C concentration at the lower stress range. The IP-TMF life was observed to be much shorter than that of the OP-TMF, with a crossover occurring at the higher stress range. Fractographic examinations showed that the fracture was predominantly intergranular in the IP-TMF mode, and transgranular, as characterized by typical fatigue striations, in the OP-TMF mode of deformation. The difference in the fracture mechanisms between the IP and OP-TMF mode of deformation was the primary reason for a significant influence of the loading mode on the TMF lifetime. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The equipment allows TMF crack propagation tests up to, at least, 600 °C. The crack length and the crack closure level were determined using the potential drop technique. Thermo-mechanical fatigue crack propagation experiments were performed in-phase and out-of-phase with various R-values on samples of Inconel 718. Cylindrical specimens with a small starter crack were cycled in nominal total strain control. The crack propagation rate was determined and the correlation to the effective J-integral range, $\Delta$Jeff, corrected for crack closure presented. The fracture surfaces showed a dominance of trans-granular crack propagation with striations, indicating a low degree of time dependency in the procedure. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Low-cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior of nickel-based precipitation -strengthened superalloy GH4145/SQ was investigated systematically under fully reversed total strain amplitude control conditions at 538 ??C in laboratory air. It was shown that the alloy exhibited a pronounced initial fatigue hardening followed by continuous fatigue softening to failure at high strain amplitudes, while at low strain amplitudes the initial hardening was followed by a well-defined saturation stage. Microstructure observations using optical and transmission-electron microscopy revealed that slip band density increased with increasing total strain amplitudes and the size of the ?????precipitates tended to reduction due to repeated shearing by the dislocations with continuous cyclic straining. The above changes in microstructures during cycling were essentially responsible for the fatigue hardening-softening behavior of the alloy. Both optical and SEM micrographs indicated that at low strain amplitudes crack propagation was basically transgranular, while at high strain amplitudes crack propagation was essentially intergranular. Bilinear behavior with a change of slope at a plastic strain amplitude of about 0.2 pct was observed in cyclic stress-strain (CSS), Coffin-Manson (C-M) and plastic strain energy-life plots. A change in the number of operating slip systems and the fracture modes with the strain amplitude employed was used to explain this two-slope characteristic. In both the companion specimens test (CST) and the incremental step test (IST) methods the alloy exhibited non-masing type behavior. It was suggested that, for the first approximation, the half-life plastic strain energy could be calculated directly according to the equation without reckoning in the non-masing behavior. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

At these temperatures also the uniaxial and biaxial-planar isothermal material behavior was studied. In order to determine the influence of the multiaxial stress state on the fatigue life biaxial-planar isothermal tests were carried out at three different strain ratios. The uniaxial isothermal lifetimes coincide very well with literature data. A conservative lifetime description for thermo-mechanical in-phase and out-of-phase fatigue test was set based on the isothermal tests at the upper temperature. The comparison of lifetimes from uniaxial and biaxial-planar tests shows that the equivalent strain hypothesis according to von Mises correlates the fatigue lives of the different stress states within a scatter band of two. The failure mechanism including crack initiation, crack growth and the macroscopic crack path were studied by scanning electron microscopy. A change from a mainly transgranular crack growth at 673 K to a mostly intergranular fracture at 923 K as well as under thermo-mechanical fatigue loading was found. The fatigue lives of the isothermal and thermo-mechanical tests under both uniaxial and biaxial-planar loading were correlated by a new lifetime model which is based on a stress¨Cstrain approach. "

The temperature range was kept constant at 250 ??C and the maximum temperatures applied were 700, 750 and 800 ??C.

In particular, out-of-phase loading conditions reduce fatigue life tremendously as compared to the corresponding isothermal conditions. The very short out-of-phase loading life can be attributed to an accelerated oxidation-induced crack initiation during tension in the low-temperature part of the TMF cycle and is a consequence of the formation of an embrittled zone at the surface during the high-temperature part of the loading cycle. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of cyclic stress amplitude, mean stress, and their histories on the ratcheting were experimentally investigated under uniaxial and different multiaxial loading paths. The shapes of non-proportional loading paths were linear, circular, elliptical and rhombic, respectively. In the constitutive model, the rate-dependent behavior of the material was reflected by a viscous term; the cyclic flow and cyclic hardening behaviors of the material under asymmetrical stress-controlled cycling were reflected by the evolution rules of kinematic hardening back stress and isotropic deforming resistance, respectively. The effect of loading history on the ratcheting was also considered by introducing two fading memorization functions for maximum inelastic strain amplitude and isotropic deformation resistance, respectively, into the constitutive model. The effect of multiaxial loading path on the ratcheting was reflected by a non-proportional factor defined in this work.

abstract = {The uniaxial, torsional and axial-torsional thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) behavior of the near-?? TiAl-alloy TNB-V5 was investigated. TMF tests were performed at 400-800??C with mechanical strain amplitudes ranging from 0.15{\%} to 0.7{\%}. The tests were conducted thermomechanically in-phase (IP) and out-of-phase (OP).For the same lifetimes, uniaxial IP tests required the highest strain amplitudes, while OP test conditions were most damaging and needed the lowest strain amplitudes. The Mises equivalent mechanical strain amplitudes of pure torsional tests were found in between uniaxial in-phase and out-of-phase tests for the same lifetimes. The non-proportional multiaxial out-of-phase test showed a lower lifetime at the same equivalent mechanical strain amplitude compared to the other types of tests.The microstructure has been characterized applying electron microscopy and microstructural parameters such as fraction of twinned grains, grain size, lamellar distance and dislocation density have been quantified. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A modification to Brown and Miller's critical plane approach is proposed to predict multiaxial fatigue life under both in-phase and out-of-phase loading conditions. The components of this modified parameter consist of the maximum shear strain amplitude and the maximum normal stress on the maximum shear strain amplitude plane. Additional cyclic hardening developed during out-of-phase loading is included in the normal stress term. Also, the mathematical formulation of this new parameter is such that variable amplitude loading can be accommodated. Experimental results from tubular specimens made of 1045 HR steel under in-phase and 90 degree out-of-phase axial-torsional straining using both sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave forms were correlated within a factor of about two employing this approach. Available Inconel 718 axial-torsional data including mean strain histories were also satisfactorily correlated using the aforementioned parameter.},

@article{Wang1993,
abstract = {A path-independent multiaxial fatigue damage criterion is proposed based on critical plane concepts: fatigue crack growth is controlled by the maximum shear strain, and an important secondary effect is due to the normal strain excursion over one reversal of the maximum shear strain. The effect of loading path on fatigue endurance is quantified by the normal strain excursion. Only one multiaxial material constant is required in the model which can be determined from uniaxial test data plus one torsional result. The parameter can be easily integrated with a shear strain-life relationship to predict low cycle fatigue lifetime. Experimental data of four different materials: En1 5R steel, I{\%} Cr-Mo-V steel, 304 stainless steel, and 316 stainless steel at two temperatures were used to verify the criterion. It is shown that the proposed parameter can satisfactorily correlate test results for various proportional and non-proportional straining paths.},

abstract = "In this paper, a constitutive model for the unified description of rate dependent and rate independent material behavior is proposed. It is applicable to isotropic metals subjected to arbitrary thermomechanical loading conditions at small strains. The focus of the model formulation is its validity for the full range of thermal and mechanical loading conditions to be covered in an industrial context by e.g. modern aero-engine designs. Consequently, the proposed model describes the material behavior on a macroscopic level covering the full temperature range from room temperature to the upper application limit under monotonic as well as cyclic loading. Special emphasis is also put on the correct representation of the observed ratcheting behavior. The most prominent features of the model are the combined treatment of both, rate dependent, as well as rate independent inelasticity through a limit surface concept, the description of primary, secondary and tertiary creep behavior and the application of an appropriate backstress evolution equation. A fully implicit integration algorithm for the proposed model is developed and implemented in connection with uniaxial integration point drivers as well as three alternative Finite Element packages. The parameters of the proposed model can be identified based on a limited number of complex cyclic tests and monotonic creep tests. After reporting on the fitting results for such tests for the Nickel-base superalloy \{IN718\} the predictive capabilities of the proposed model are assessed for a number of isothermal and nonisothermal tests. Finally, the performance of the algorithmic implementation into the Finite Element packages is briefly addressed. "
