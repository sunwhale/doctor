\section{Design and development of radiation furnace for TGMF tests}
In this section, the high temperature radiation furnace is applied.
It is used to heat the single crystal specimens with thermal barrier coating up to a high temperature.
The furnace is matching with the MTS 809 Axial/Torsional fatigue testing machine.
Specimen heating can be accomplished by various techniques including induction, direct resistance, radiant, or forced air heating.
%There are several techniques to heat the specimen such as




%中文
%The mainly heating methods of high temperature material experiments are: environmental high temperature furnace, high frequency electromagnetic induction heating and radiation heating.
Forced air heating furnace can be used for all kinds of material. It has good temperature stability and mostly used in isothermal material tests, but it is not suitable for the experiments which need rapid temperature change.

Induction heating is the process of heating an electrically conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, through heat generated in the object by eddy currents. An induction heater consists of an electromagnet, and an electronic oscillator which passes a high-frequency alternating current (AC) through the electromagnet. The rapidly alternating magnetic field penetrates the object, generating electric currents inside the conductor called eddy currents. The eddy currents flowing through the resistance of the material heat it by Joule heating.

An important feature of the induction heating process is that the heat is generated inside the object itself, instead of by an external heat source via heat conduction. Thus objects can be very rapidly heated.
Induction heating is convenient to match up an additional air cooling system, which commonly used in thermal mechanical fatigue test, but induction heating method is not suitable for heating non-metallic materials.

\subsection{Mechanisms of heat transfer}
Heat transfer describes the exchange of thermal energy and it is normally from a high temperature object to a lower temperature object.
%The exchange of kinetic energy of particles through the boundary between two systems which are at different temperatures from each other or from their surroundings.
%Heat transfer always occurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature.
Heat transfer changes the internal energy of both systems involved according to the First Law of Thermodynamics.
And the Second Law of Thermodynamics defines the concept of thermodynamic entropy, by measurable heat transfer.
Thermal equilibrium is reached when all involved bodies and the surroundings reach the same temperature.
%Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature.
The fundamental modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation.
In the engineering sciences, heat transfer includes the processes of thermal conduction, radiation, convection, and sometimes mass transfer.
Usually more than one of these processes occurs in a given situation as shown in \ref{Fig:HeatTransfer}.

\subsubsection{Thermal conduction}
Thermal conduction is the transfer of internal energy by microscopic diffusion and collisions of particles or quasi-particles within a body.
%The microscopically diffusing and colliding objects include molecules, atoms, and electrons.
%They transfer disorganized microscopic kinetic and potential energy, which are jointly known as internal energy.
Conduction can only take place within an object or material, or between two objects that are in contact with each other.
%Conduction takes place in all phases of ponderable matter, such as solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, but it is distinctly recognizable only when the matter is undergoing neither chemical reaction nor differential local internal flows of distinct chemical constituents.
%In the presence of such chemically defined contributory sub-processes, only the flow of internal energy is recognizable, as distinct from thermal conduction. When the processes of conduction yield a net flow of energy across a boundary because of a temperature gradient, the process is characterized as a flow of heat.
%Heat spontaneously flows from a hotter to a colder body. In the absence of external drivers, temperature differences decay over time, and the bodies approach thermal equilibrium.

%In conduction, the heat flow is within and through the body itself.
%In contrast, in heat transfer by thermal radiation, the transfer is often between bodies, which may be separated spatially.
%Also possible is transfer of heat by a combination of conduction and thermal radiation.
%In convection, internal energy is carried between bodies by a material carrier. In solids, conduction is mediated by the combination of vibrations and collisions of molecules, of propagation and collisions of phonons, and of diffusion and collisions of free electrons.
%In gases and liquids, conduction is due to the collisions and diffusion of molecules during their random motion. Photons in this context do not collide with one another, and so heat transport by electromagnetic radiation is conceptually distinct from heat conduction by microscopic diffusion and collisions of material particles and phonons. In condensed matter, such as a solid or liquid, the distinction between conduction and radiative transfer of heat is clear in physical concept, but it is often not phenomenologically clear, unless the material is semi-transparent.

%In the engineering sciences, heat transfer includes the processes of thermal radiation, convection, and sometimes mass transfer. Usually more than one of these processes occurs in a given situation. The conventional symbol for the material property, thermal conductivity, is $k$.

%The law of heat conduction, also known as Fourier's law, states that the time rate of heat transfer through a material is proportional to the negative gradient in the temperature and to the area, at right angles to that gradient, through which the heat flows.

An empirical relationship between the conduction rate in a material and the temperature gradient in the direction of energy flow, first formulated by Fourier who concluded that the heat flux resulting from thermal conduction is proportional to the magnitude of the temperature gradient and opposite to it in sign.
For a three directional conduction, the differential form of Fourier's Law of thermal conduction may be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
{\bf{q}} =  - k\nabla T
\end{equation}
where $\bf{q}$ is the local heat flux density(W/m$^2$), $k$ is the material's conductivity(W/mK), $\nabla T$ is the temperature gradient(K/m).
The heat flux density is the amount of energy that flows through a unit area per unit time.
The thermal conductivity, k, is often treated as a constant, though this is not always true.
While the thermal conductivity of a material generally varies with temperature, the variation can be small over a significant range of temperatures for some common materials.
In anisotropic materials, the thermal conductivity typically varies with orientation; in this case k is represented by a second-order tensor. In non uniform materials, k varies with spatial location.

\subsubsection{Thermal convection}

Convective heat transfer, often referred to simply as convection, is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids.
Two types of convective heat transfer may be distinguished: free convection and forced convection.
Free convection describes when fluid motion is caused by buoyancy forces that result from the density variations due to variations of thermal temperature in the fluid.
Forced convection describes when a fluid is forced to flow over the surface by an external source such as fans, by stirring, and pumps, creating an artificially induced convection current.

    \begin{figure}[!htp]
        \centering\scalebox{0.8}{\includegraphics{Thermal_boundary_layer.pdf}}
        \caption{Thermal boundary layer.}
        \label{Thermal_boundary_layer}
    \end{figure}

Convection is sometimes assumed to be described by Newton's law.
Newton's law, which requires a heat transfer coefficient, states that the rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings. %The constant of proportionality is the heat transfer coefficient.
As shown in \ref{Thermal_boundary_layer}, the basic relationship for heat transfer by convection is:
%The heat transfer rate can be written as,
    \begin{equation}
    q_y=hA(T_s-T_{\infty})
    \end{equation}
where $q_y$ is the heat transferred per unit time, $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $T_s$ is the object's surface temperature and $T_{\infty}$ is the fluid temperature.

%And because heat transfer at the surface is by conduction,
%    \begin{equation}
%    q_y=-kA \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (T-T_{s})|_{y=0}
%    \end{equation}
%These two terms are equal; thus
%    \begin{equation}
%    -kA \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (T-T_{s})|_{y=0} = hA(T_s-T_{\infty})
%    \end{equation}
%Rearranging,
%    \begin{equation}
%    \frac{h}{k}=\frac{\frac{\partial (T_s-T)}{\partial y}|_{y=0}}{\frac{T_s-T_{\infty}}{L}}
%    \end{equation}
%Making it dimensionless by multiplying by representative length L,
%    \begin{equation}
%    \frac{hL}{k}=\frac{\frac{\partial (T_s-T)}{\partial y}|_{y=0}}{T_s-T_{\infty}}
%    \label{tab:Nusselt1}
%    \end{equation}


%Convective heat transfer is one of the major modes of heat transfer and convection is also a major mode of mass transfer in fluids.  Therefore, influence of fluid field factors will impact the convective heat transfer. There are five aspects:
%
%
%1.Natural convection and forced convection.
%
%
%$\bullet$ Natural Convection.
%
%The onset of natural convection is determined by the Rayleigh number (Ra). This dimensionless number is given by:
%
%    \begin{equation}
%        Ra=\frac{\Delta \rho g L^3}{D \mu}
%        \label{tab:RayleighNumber}
%    \end{equation}
%
%where
%
%    $\Delta \rho$ is the difference in density between the two parcels of material that are mixing,\par
%    g is the local gravitational acceleration,\par
%    L is the characteristic length-scale of convection,\par
%    D is the diffusivity of the characteristic that is causing the convection,\par
%    $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\par
%
%$\bullet$ Forced convection.
%
%In general, natural convection flow rate is low, the natural convection heat transfer coefficient is usually lower than the forced convection heat transfer coefficient.
%
%2.Laminar flow and turbulent flow.
%
%$\bullet$ Limina flow.
%
%Laminar flow occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between the layers.In the perpendicular direction, the heat transfer depends mainly on molecular diffusion (ie, thermal conductivity).
%
%$\bullet$ Turbulent flow.
%
%There are strong pulsation and vortex. The fluids between various parts mix rapidly, so turbulent convection effect is stronger than laminar flow.
%
%3.Phase transition.
%
%$\bullet$ Boiling.
%
%$\bullet$ Condensation.
%
%4.The physical properties of the fluid.
%
%$\bullet$ Thermal conductivity k,$[W/(m \cdot K)]$. If the fluid thermal conductivity is larger, thermal resistance become smaller. Convective heat transfer is more intense.
%
%$\bullet$ Density $\rho$, $[kg/m^3]$.
%
%$\bullet$ Specific heat capacity c,$[J/(kg \cdot K)]$.
%
%$\rho c$ reflects the size of the heat capacity of unit volume of fluid. The greater its value is, the more heat is transferred by convection, and the convective heat transfer is more intense.
%
%
%$\bullet$ Dynamic viscosity $\eta$, $[Pa \cdot s]$. Kinematic viscosity $\nu=\eta /\rho$, $[m^2/s]$. The viscosity of the fluid affect the velocity distribution and flow pattern, so it affects the convective heat transfer.
%
%$\bullet$ Volume expansion coefficient $\alpha_V$, $[K^{-1}]$. In the general case of a gas, liquid, or solid, the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion is given by
%
%    \begin{equation}
%        \alpha_V=\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_p
%        \label{tab:ExpansionCoefficient}
%    \end{equation}
%
%For an ideal gas, the volumetric thermal expansivity (i.e. relative change in volume due to temperature change) depends on the type of process in which temperature is changed. Two known cases are isobaric change, where pressure is held constant, and adiabatic change, where no work is done and no change in entropy occurs.
%
%In an isobaric process, the volumetric thermal expansivity, which we denote $\beta_p$,(The index p denotes an isobaric process) is:
%
%    \begin{equation}
%        PV = nRT
%    \end{equation}
%    \begin{equation}
%        \ln\left(V\right) = \ln \left(T\right) + \ln\left(nR/P\right)
%    \end{equation}
%    \begin{equation}
%        \beta_p = \bigg(\frac{1}{V} \frac{dV}{dT}\bigg)_p = \bigg(\frac{d(ln V)}{d T}\bigg)_p = \frac{d(ln T)}{d T} = \frac{1}{T}
%    \end{equation}
%
%5.The geometric factors of the heat transfer surface.
%
%Geometry, size, relative position, roughness and other geometric factors will affect the flow of fluid, and therefore affect the fluid velocity distribution and the convective heat transfer. The surface heat transfer coefficient is a function of many variables.


\subsubsection{Thermal radiation}
Thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero.
It represents a conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy.
All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation. When the temperature of the body is greater than absolute zero, inter-atomic collisions cause the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules to change. This results in charge-acceleration and/or dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation, and the wide spectrum of radiation reflects the wide spectrum of energies and accelerations that occur even at a single temperature.

Thermal radiation power of a black body per unit area of radiating surface per unit of solid angle and per unit frequency $\nu$ is given by Planck's law as:
\begin{equation}
u(\nu,T)=\frac{2 h\nu^3}{c^2}\cdot\frac1{e^{h\nu/k_BT}-1},
\end{equation}
or in terms of wavelength
\begin{equation}
u(\lambda,T)=\frac{\beta}{\lambda^5}\cdot\frac1{e^{hc/k_BT\lambda}-1},
\end{equation}
where $h=6.626\times10^{-34}J \cdot s$ is Planck's constant, $b=2.898\times10^{-3}m \cdot K$ is Wien's displacement constant, $k_{B}=1.381\times10^{-23}J \cdot K^{-1}$ is Boltzmann constant and $c$ is the speed of light.

This formula mathematically follows from calculation of spectral distribution of energy in Quantization (physics)|quantized electromagnetic field which is in complete thermal equilibrium with the radiating object. The equation is derived as an infinite sum over all possible frequencies. The energy, $E=h \nu$, of each photon is multiplied by the number of states available at that frequency, and the probability that each of those states will be occupied.

Integrating the above equation over $\nu$ the power output given by the StefanCBoltzmann law is obtained, as:
\begin{equation}
P = \sigma \cdot A \cdot T^4,
\label{Equ:IntegratingOfStefanBoltzmann}
\end{equation}
where the constant of proportionality $\sigma=5.670\times10^{-8}\rm{W}\cdot \rm{m}^{-2}\cdot \rm{K}^{-1}$ is the StefanCBoltzmann constant and $A$ is the radiating surface area.

The wavelength $\lambda \,$, for which the emission intensity is highest, is given by Wien's displacement law as
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{max} = \frac{b}{T}.
\end{equation}
For surfaces which are not black bodies, one has to consider the (generally frequency dependent) emissivity factor $\epsilon(\nu)$. This factor has to be multiplied with the radiation spectrum formula before integration. If it is taken as a constant, the resulting formula for the power output can be written in a way that contains $\epsilon$ as a factor:
\begin{equation}
P = \epsilon \cdot \sigma \cdot A \cdot T^4.
\end{equation}

This type of theoretical model, with frequency-independent emissivity lower than that of a perfect black body, is often known as a 'grey body'. For frequency-dependent emissivity, the solution for the integrated power depends on the functional form of the dependence, though in general there is no simple expression for it. Practically speaking, if the emissivity of the body is roughly constant around the peak emission wavelength, the gray body model tends to work fairly well since the weight of the curve around the peak emission tends to dominate the integral.

\subsection{Temperature Measurement}
\subsubsection{Thermocouple}
A thermocouple is a sensor for measuring temperature.
It consists of two dissimilar metal wires, joined at one end.
%When properly configured, thermocouples can provide temperature measurements over a wide range of temperatures.
In contrast to most other methods of temperature measurement, thermocouples are self powered and require no external form of excitation.
The physical principle of the thermocouple is Seebeck effect.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics{Seebeck_Voltage.pdf}}
\caption{Schematic of Seebeck effect.}
\label{Fig:Seebeck_Voltage}
\end{figure}
In 1821 the German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck discovered the continuous current flow in the thermoelectric circuit when two wires of dissimilar metals are joined at both ends and one of the ends is heated, and that is the Seebeck effect.
If this circuit is broken at the center (see \ref{Fig:Seebeck_Voltage}), the net open circuit voltage $e_{AB}$ (the Seebeck voltage) is a function of the junction temperature and the composition of the two metals.
This was because the electron energy levels in each metal shifted differently and a voltage difference between the junctions.
We can't measure the Seebeck voltage directly because we must first connect a voltmeter to the thermocouple, and the voltmeter leads themselves create a new thermoelectric circuit.

A thermocouple is an electrical device consisting of two different conductors forming electrical junctions at differing temperatures. A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent voltage as a result of the thermoelectric effect, and this voltage can be interpreted to measure temperature.
The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa. A thermoelectric device creates voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature gradient causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{1.2}{\includegraphics{Thermocouple_circuit_Ktype_including_voltmeter_temperature.pdf}}
\caption{K-type thermocouple in the standard thermocouple measurement configuration.}
\label{Fig:Thermocouple_circuit_Ktype_including_voltmeter_temperature}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Thermocouple direct and inverse polynomials}
Once we obtain the voltage from the thermocouple we have to convert the voltage to a temperature.
As shown in \ref{Fig:Thermocouples}, output voltages for the type K, R and S thermocouples are plotted as a function of temperature.
Unfortunately, the temperature-versus-voltage relationship of the thermocouple is not linear.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{Thermocouples.pdf}}
\caption{Characteristic functions for thermocouples types K, R, S.}
\label{Fig:Thermocouples}
\end{figure}
Therefore, polynomials are used to present the temperature-versus-voltage and the inverse relationship.
Direct polynomials (see Equation \ref{Equ:Direct_polynomials}) provide the thermoelectric voltage from a known temperature and inverse polynomials (see Equation \ref{Equ:Inverse_polynomials}) provide the temperature from a known thermoelectric voltage.
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:Direct_polynomials}
E = {c_0} + {c_1}T + {c_2}{T^2} + ... + {c_n}{T^n} = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^n {{c_i}{T^i}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:Inverse_polynomials}
T = {k_0} + {k_1}E + {k_2}{E^2} + ... + {k_n}{E^n} = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^n {{k_i}{E^i}}
\end{equation}
Where, $T$ is temperature in degrees Celsius ($^{\circ} \rm{C}$), $E$ is thermocouple electric potential in microvolts (${\rm{\mu V}}$), $c_i,k_i$ are polynomial coefficients unique to each type thermocouple, $n$ is the maximum order of the polynomial.
As n increases, the accuracy of the polynomial improves.
A representative number is $n = 9$ for $\pm 1 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$ accuracy.

In order to obtain the higher accuracy and system speed, the polynomials may be divided into several small sectors over a narrow temperature range.
In the software for our data acquisition system, the thermocouple characteristic curve is divided into three sectors, and each sector is approximated by a nine or ten order
polynomial.
%as well as used in our temperature measurement system.
For example, type R thermocouples coefficients of the approximate direct/inverse polynomials are given in Table \ref{tab:TypeRDirectPolynomial} and \ref{tab:TypeRInversePolynomial}.
%Further more, the similar coefficients wtype K and type S thermocouples are also used in our temperature measurement system.

Three types (K, R, S) of thermocouples are used in our temperature measurement system for different temperature ranges.

\subsection{Experiment and simulation of single halogen lamp under free radiation condition}
A halogen lamp, also known as a tungsten halogen or quartz-halogen, is an incandescent lamp that has a small amount of a halogen such as iodine or bromine added.
The combination of the halogen gas and the tungsten filament produces a halogen cycle chemical reaction which redeposits evaporated tungsten back onto the filament, increasing its life and maintaining the clarity of the envelope.
Because of this, a halogen lamp can be operated at a higher temperature than a standard gas-filled lamp of similar power and operating life, producing light of a higher luminous efficacy and color temperature.
The small size of halogen lamps permits their use in compact optical systems for projectors and illumination.
我们系统由16盏卤素灯组成，每盏灯有各自对应的椭圆柱面反射镜，通过镜面反射将光线聚焦在试件表面，从而达到加热的目的。
经过前面小节对传热学的简介，要确定这样一个系统的温度状态，我们需要知道卤素灯的辐射效率，镜面的反射效率，试件表面的辐射吸收率，以及试件内外表面的热对流系数。
我们的研究分为三个步骤：
1.单盏卤素灯的自由辐射试验，确定单盏卤素灯的辐射效率，及物体表面的辐射吸收率；
2.单盏卤素灯的镜面聚光加热试验，确定镀金镜面的反射效率，及物体表面的对流换热系数；

1.连接并检查所有的热电偶至数据采集器。
2.将数据采集器连接至电脑，确认系统连接无误。
3.开启数据采样程序。
4.开启卤素灯电源，试验装置开始辐射加热，记录开启的时间。
5.关闭卤素灯电源，试验装置进入自由冷却阶段，记录电源关闭的时间。
6.当试验装置冷却至室温时，关闭数据采样程序，并将采集到的数据保存至指定文件。
每次试验可以得到10个热电偶测温点和1个红外测温点的随时间变化的温度曲线。
试验中使用不同功率的卤素灯（240W，350W和400W），可以得到不同功率的卤素灯对系统的加热和冷却曲线。

得到了试验结果之后，我们需要对结果进行整理，并根据数值计算确定壁面的对流换热系数及表面散射率。
使用ABAQUS的Heat transfer模块进行计算。
对于含有辐射传热的计算模型，两个常数需要提前定义，Stefan-Boltzmann常数，$\sigma=5.670\times10^{-8}\rm{W}\cdot \rm{m}^{-2}\cdot \rm{K}^{-1}$，绝对零度-273.15$^{\circ}$C。
对于瞬态温度计算，材料的热传导系数、密度和比热容需要被定义。
这里的圆柱壁面材料为SS304不锈钢，随着温度的升高，SS304不锈钢的传热系数也会增大，不同温度下的材料传热系数如Table \ref{Tab:SS304HeatTransfer}所示。
忽略温度对密度和比热容的影响，在这里定义SS304不锈钢的密度为7873kg/m$^3$，比热容(Specific Heat Capacity)为500J/(kg$\cdot$K)。

单盏卤素灯的自由辐射试验，可以简化为一中空柱状面（灯丝），在密闭空间内的辐射传热模型。
由于系统的对称性，以圆柱中心截面作为对称面，建立1/2的计算模型，如\ref{Fig:OneLightRadiationSimulation}(c)所示。

以400W卤素灯为例，经过测量灯芯长度为68mm(see \ref{Fig:OneLightRadiation}(a))，灯芯色温2950K。根据Equation \ref{Equ:IntegratingOfStefanBoltzmann}我们可以计算灯芯表面辐射面积为：
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{P}{\sigma \cdot T^4} = \frac{400}{5.670\times10^{-8}\times2950^4}=9.316\times10^{-5} {\rm{m}}^2,
\end{equation}
由于我们将灯芯等效为理想圆柱面，已知圆柱面的表面积93.16${\rm{mm}}^2$和长度68mm，所以可以计算得出圆柱面的直径为0.436mm。

已知环境温度25$^{\circ}$C，空气自然对流换热系数的范围是5到25W/(${\rm{m}}^2\cdot$K)。
使用trial and error方法，可以得到内壁面的表面散射率为0.95，外壁面的表面散射率为0.68，对流换热系数5.6W/(${\rm{m}}^2\cdot$K)。
使用相同的模型参数，分别对240W、350W和400W功率卤素灯的自由辐射传热进行计算，选取外壁面中心点的温度值进行对比，如\ref{Fig:OneLightRadiationSimulation}(d-f)所示。
数值模拟结果、热电偶测量值和红外温度测量仪所得到的温度值在加热和冷却两个过程中都得到了很好的吻合，这说明我们使用的材料常数和传热学参数是正确的。

Ellipsoidal reflectors have two conjugate foci. Light from one focus passes through the other after reflection (see \ref{Fig:EllipsoidalReflectors}).
Deep ellipsoids of revolution surrounding a source collect a much higher fraction of total emitted light than a spherical mirror or conventional lens system.
The effective collection are very small, and the geometry is well suited to the spatial distribution of the output from an arc lamp.
Two ellipsoids can almost fully enclose a light source and target to provide nearly total energy transfer.
    \begin{figure}[!htp]
        \centering\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics{Ellipsoidal_reflectors.png}}
        \caption{A section of an ellipsoidal reflector. }
        \label{Fig:EllipsoidalReflectors}
    \end{figure}
More significant perhaps is the ellipsoid's effect upon imaging of extended sources.
For a pure point source exactly at one focus of the ellipse, almost all of the energy is transferred to the other focus.
Unfortunately, every real light source, such as a lamp arc, has some finite extent; points of the source that are not exactly at the focus of the ellipse will be magnified and defocused at the image.

\ref{Fig:EllipsoidalReflectors} illustrates how light from point S, off the focus F1, does not reimage near F2, but is instead spread along the axis.
Rays a, b and c, shown in the top half of the ellipse, are all from F1 and pass through F2, the second focus of the ellipse. Rays A, B and C, in the bottom half of the ellipse are exact ray traces for rays from a point close to F1. They strike the ellipse at equivalent points to a, b and c, but do not pass through F2. For a small spot (image) at F2 you need a very small source.
Because of this effect ellipsoids are most useful when coupled with a small source and a system that requires a lot of light without concern for particularly good imaging.

根据灯丝形状不同光源可以被简化为点光源和直线光源两种。
%点光源的聚光采用椭圆球面镜，将点光源放置于椭圆球面镜的其中一个焦点，经过反射光线会聚焦至另一个焦点。
参考德宇航的设计，我们采用管状卤素灯作为光源。
上一节根据灯丝的形状，将光源简化为理想中空圆柱面。
如果我们使用椭圆柱面镜，将卤素灯放置在其中一个焦点处，则可以将光线全部反射到另一个焦点。

我们建立了单盏卤素灯通过镜面反射进行辐射传热的试验装置。
试验装置包括灯头固定部件、椭圆柱面镜和受光平板等，各个部件的位置如\ref{Fig:OneLightWithEllipseMirrorReflectionShow}(a,b)所示。
卤素灯位于椭圆柱面镜的其中一个焦点，它所发出的光线，经过椭圆柱面镜反射后，照射到通过椭圆柱面镜另一个焦点的平面上。
灯丝的直径、灯丝与镜面的相对位置、镜面的表面粗糙度和镜面的轴线方向都会影响受光平面上的光强度分布。

受光平板的材料选取SS304不锈钢，表面采用耐高温黑色涂料喷涂。
和上一节类似，我们选择K型热电偶测量平板表面的温度分布。
热电偶的位置分布如\ref{Fig:OneLightWithEllipseMirrorReflectionShow}(c)所示，共15个。
热电偶的数据采集，同样选取National Instruments公司的9213型16通道热电偶数据采集器，相应的编程和数据处理过程与上一节类似，采样频率为10Hz。

\subsection{Design of the radiation furnace}

\section{Extensometer}
An extensometer is a device that is used to measure changes in the length of an object.
It is useful for stress-strain measurements and tensile tests.
There are many different types of high temperature extensometers available.
The type of extensometer is dependent on the type of testing and the type of heating system used.

There are two observation windows at both side of the developed radiation furnace as shown in \ref{Fig:ObservationWindow}.
The distance between each observation window and the specimen outer surface is 160mm.
Due to the long distance, Epsilon Model 3448 high temperature extensometer was selected.
% to mount with the radiation furnace
It has two ceramic rods which are made of high purity alumina.
They pass through the furnace and contact the specimen.
These are available in lengths as required to fit the furnace.
The extensometer is typically used for high temperature tension, compression and fatigue testing.
Its gauge length is 10mm with $\pm20\%$ full scale range.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.3}{\includegraphics{ObservationWindow.png}}
\caption{The observation window of radiation furnace.}
\label{Fig:ObservationWindow}
\end{figure}

The extensometer were held on the specimen by light, flexible ceramic fiber cords as shown in \ref{Fig:Epsilon3448}.
These make the extensometer self-supporting on the specimen.
No furnace mounting brackets are required.
The side load on the test sample is greatly reduced because of the self-supporting design and light weight of the sensor.
The combination of radiant heat shields and convection cooling fins allow this model to be used at specimen temperatures up to 1200$^{\circ}$C without cooling.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering\scalebox{0.12}{\includegraphics{Epsilon3448.png}}
\caption{Self-supporting on the specimen.}
\label{Fig:Epsilon3448}
\end{figure}

%An extensometer is a sensor attached to a specimen that measures a dimensional change (gage length or strain) that occurs in the specimen during testing.
The extensometer works by means of precision resistance-type strain gages bonded to a metallic element to form a Wheatstone bridge circuit.
It requires special test fixtures to aid in calibration.
%An extensometer requires DC excitation, which requires either a dedicated DC conditioner or a digital universal conditioner (DUC) configured in the DC mode.
In general, calibration is effected by connecting the extensometer into the extensometer socket on the loading frame and accurately setting the strain channel output, observed on a digital readout or recorder display against a precise, known displacement of the extensometer.
To assist in this operation, the high magnification extensometer calibrator GWB-200JA is available.
%The extensometer calibrator is used either where an extensometer does not feature electrical calibration or when a manual verification of the output is desired.

The calibration fixture, illustrated at \ref{Fig:Calibration}, consists of a precision micrometer head that drives a separate moveable shaft.
The micrometer head and shaft are mounted on a frame and the extensometer is attached between the moving and stationary shafts.
%Displacement is shown via a dial scale.
%It enables the extensometer to be exercised over its mechanical displacement range and permits the accurate adjustment of an extensometer over very small distances for tensile or compressive calibration.
%The extensometer is mounted to the separate moveable shaft.
%One of the shaft is adjustable, while the other remains stationary.
As the micrometer is adjusted, the lower shaft moves and displacement is applied to the extensometer.
The elongation is read from the dial scale of the micrometer head. This can be used to either verify the output of the extensometer shown on the test system or to set zero and full scale output to calibrate it initially.

\section{Forced convection in turbulent pipe flow}
试件的内部直径为6.5mm，并没有找到合适的方法在试验过程中测量内壁的温度。
因此我们将试件简化为圆管，根据圆管内部的强制对流换热公式计算试件内表面的对流换热系数，通过数值计算得到试件内壁的温度分布。

Gnielinski's correlation for turbulent flow in tubes:
\[{\rm{N}}{{\rm{u}}_D} = \frac{{\left( {f/8} \right)\left( {{\rm{R}}{{\rm{e}}_D} - 1000} \right){\rm{Pr}}}}{{1 + 12.7{{(f/8)}^{1/2}}\left( {{\rm{P}}{{\rm{r}}^{2/3}} - 1} \right)}}\]
where f is the Darcy friction factor that can either be obtained from the Moody chart or for smooth tubes from correlation developed by Petukhov
\[f = {\left( {0.79\ln \left( {{\rm{R}}{{\rm{e}}_D}} \right) - 1.64} \right)^{ - 2}}\]

\[0.5 \le {\rm{Pr}} \le 2000\]
\[3000 \le {\rm{R}}{{\rm{e}}_D} \le 5 \times {10^6}\]

temperature $T=15+273.15=288.15\rm{K}$

pressure $p=6.5\rm{bar}$

density $\rho_0= 1.293\rm{kg/m^3}$

Dynamic viscosity $\mu$ of an ideal gas is a function of the temperature. It can be derived as Sutherland's formula:
\[\mu  = {\mu _0}\frac{{{T_0} + C}}{{T + C}}{\left( {\frac{T}{{{T_0}}}} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\]
where $\mu$ is dynamic viscosity at input temperature $T$,
$\mu_0$ is reference viscosity at reference temperature $T_0$,
$C$ is Sutherland's constant dependent on the gaseous material.
Table \ref{tab:SutherlandConstant} shows the Sutherland's constant and reference values of the air.
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{Sutherland's constant and reference values of the air.}
    \begin{tabular}{p{2cm}p{2cm}p{2cm}p{3cm}}
    \toprule
    Gas   & $C$(K) & $T_0$(K) & $\mu_0$($\rm{Pa\cdot s}$) \\
    \midrule
    air   & 120   & 291.15 & $1.827\times 10^{-5}$ \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
  \label{tab:SutherlandConstant}%
\end{table}%

The density of dry air $\rho$ can be calculated using the ideal gas law, expressed as a function of temperature and pressure:
\begin{equation}
\rho  = \frac{p}{{RT}}
\label{Equ:AirDensity}
\end{equation}
where 
$p$ is absolute pressure in Pa,
$T$ is absolute temperature in K,
$R$ is specific gas constant and for dry air $R = 287.058 \rm{J/(kg\cdot K)}$.

The average pressure of inner cooling air is 6.5 bar. With Equation \ref{Equ:AirDensity}, we obtain the air density at 6.5 bar is 7.858 $\rm{kg/m^3}$.


inner diameter of specimen $d_{in} = 0.0065\rm{mm}$

volume flow ${\dot V} = 25\rm{l/min}$
